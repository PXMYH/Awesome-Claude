  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and structured with clear sections for
      blockchain domains, but it lacks a complete implementation workflow and has
      abrupt endings. It follows best practices with checklists and structured protocols,
      though the incomplete workflow reduces clarity and actionability.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides comprehensive coverage of blockchain development
      domains, security patterns, and optimization techniques, making it highly valuable
      for real-world development tasks. It includes practical checklists and architecture
      guidance that developers can immediately apply to projects.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured blockchain developer prompt with extensive domain coverage
    and security focus, though incomplete implementation guidance limits its immediate
    usability.
