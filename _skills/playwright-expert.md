  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear role definition,
      specific constraints (MUST DO/MUST NOT DO), and a reference guide system. It
      follows best practices by defining scope, triggers, and output format. The only
      minor weakness is the reference guide references external files that may not
      exist, but the structure itself is excellent.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world Playwright development, covering
      the full workflow from setup to debugging. The constraints prevent common anti-patterns
      like flaky waits and brittle selectors. The Page Object Model guidance and CI/CD
      integration focus make it immediately actionable for professional testing workflows.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An expertly crafted prompt that provides comprehensive Playwright guidance
    with strong constraints and practical workflow, making it highly valuable for
    E2E testing tasks.
