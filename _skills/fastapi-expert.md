  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear role definition,
      specific constraints, and actionable workflow. It follows best practices by
      defining triggers, scope, and output format upfront. The only minor limitation
      is the reference guide assumes external files exist, which could be a dependency
      issue in some environments.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate, high-value guidance for real-world FastAPI
      development with modern practices like Pydantic V2 and async SQLAlchemy. The
      constraints and templates directly address common pitfalls and accelerate implementation.
      It's comprehensive enough for production-grade API development while remaining
      practical for developers.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A highly effective, production-ready skill prompt that excels in clarity,
    specificity, and practical value for FastAPI development.
