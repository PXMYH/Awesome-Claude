  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides a clear role definition and comprehensive checklist
      of technical writing standards, but it's incomplete and contains a truncated
      development workflow section. The communication protocol is well-structured
      with JSON formatting, but the abrupt ending limits its practical usability.
      While the content covers many technical writing aspects, the incomplete structure
      reduces clarity for actual implementation.
  usefulness:
    score: 3.0
    reasoning: The prompt outlines valuable technical writing frameworks and documentation
      types that would be useful for creating comprehensive documentation. However,
      the incomplete development workflow and lack of concrete execution steps limit
      immediate actionability. The extensive checklists and standards are theoretically
      valuable but need completion to be practically useful for real-world documentation
      tasks.
  overall_rating: 3.25
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete technical writing prompt that establishes
    strong foundations but requires completion of the development workflow section
    to be fully functional.
