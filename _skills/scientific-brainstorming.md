  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with a logical
      workflow and specific techniques. It defines scope and constraints effectively,
      though it could benefit from more explicit guidance on handling overly vague
      user inputs or when to transition between phases.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill offers high practical value for researchers and scientists
      in early-stage ideation, providing actionable techniques for creative exploration.
      It is comprehensive for its intended use case, though its utility is somewhat
      specialized to scientific domains and may be less immediately applicable for
      general users.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-crafted, high-quality prompt that excels in guiding creative scientific
    brainstorming with clear structure and practical techniques, though its niche
    focus may limit broader applicability.
