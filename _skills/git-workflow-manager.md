  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides a comprehensive list of Git concepts and workflows,
      but it's incomplete and lacks clear execution instructions. The prompt cuts
      off mid-sentence in the 'Workflow evaluation' section, creating ambiguity about
      expected behavior and limiting clarity for the agent.
  usefulness:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The skill covers valuable Git workflow concepts that could help teams
      optimize their version control practices. However, the incomplete structure
      and missing concrete action steps reduce its immediate practicality for users
      seeking specific Git workflow solutions.
  overall_rating: 3.25
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete prompt that comprehensively lists Git
    workflow concepts but lacks clear execution guidance and cuts off before providing
    actionable instructions.
