  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates strong structural organization with clear sections
      for methodology, techniques, and quality assurance. However, it lacks specific
      instructions for tool usage (Read, Grep, Glob, WebFetch, WebSearch) and has
      incomplete sections (e.g., 'Create ti' is truncated). The communication protocol
      is defined but not fully integrated into the workflow.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides a comprehensive framework for research analysis
      with valuable checklists and methodologies that could guide systematic research.
      It covers multiple domains and quality assurance processes that are practical
      for real-world research tasks. However, the incomplete development workflow
      and lack of explicit tool integration reduce immediate actionability.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured research analyst prompt with strong methodological foundations
    but needs completion of truncated sections and clearer tool integration to reach
    full potential.
