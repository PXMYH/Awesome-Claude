  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt has a clear structure with defined sections and a comprehensive
      checklist of Vue expertise areas. However, it lacks specific instructions for
      the agent's actual behavior when invoked, contains incomplete sections (e.g.,
      'Implementation Phase' is cut off), and the communication protocol is overly
      verbose without clear action steps. The checklist items are good but need to
      be translated into actionable guidance.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt covers a comprehensive range of Vue 3 development topics
      including Composition API, Nuxt 3, performance optimization, and enterprise
      patterns, making it highly valuable for real-world Vue development. The detailed
      checklists and topic areas provide excellent reference material for developers.
      However, the incomplete workflow and lack of concrete implementation steps reduce
      immediate practicality.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured Vue expertise prompt with comprehensive topic coverage
    but needs completion of workflow sections and more actionable implementation guidance
    to be fully effective.
