  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, practical
      code examples, and specific guidance. However, it contains a truncated code
      snippet in the 'Configure Resources' section that cuts off mid-example, which
      slightly impacts completeness. The documentation-style format is professional
      and follows best practices for technical skill prompts.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world AI/ML development, covering
      essential Modal features like GPU allocation, container images, and serverless
      deployment. The prompt provides actionable code examples for common scenarios
      (ML model deployment, batch processing, GPU inference) and includes authentication
      setup, making it immediately usable for developers.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready skill prompt that effectively guides users
    on deploying Python code to Modal's serverless platform, with strong technical
    documentation and practical examples for AI/ML workloads.
