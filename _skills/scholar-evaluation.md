  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear workflow steps,
      defined evaluation dimensions, and specific instructions. It includes helpful
      metadata and licensing information. However, it references external documentation
      (`references/evaluation_framework.md`) that isn't provided, which could create
      ambiguity in actual implementation.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill addresses a genuine need in academic and research contexts,
      providing systematic evaluation methodology that could save time and improve
      consistency in peer review. The structured approach with quantitative scoring
      and actionable feedback is highly practical for researchers, reviewers, and
      students.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A comprehensive, well-designed evaluation framework that provides systematic
    scholarly assessment with clear methodology and practical value, though it depends
    on external reference materials that may not be available.
