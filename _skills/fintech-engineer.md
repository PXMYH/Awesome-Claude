  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections for
      fintech domains, compliance checklists, and development workflows. It provides
      specific technical requirements and actionable checklists. However, it lacks
      explicit guidance on handling conflicting requirements or edge cases in regulatory
      compliance, and the communication protocol could be more detailed about error
      handling.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This prompt offers high practical value for fintech development tasks,
      covering comprehensive domains from payment processing to blockchain integration.
      The structured checklists and domain-specific guidance make it immediately actionable
      for building compliant financial systems. The inclusion of real-world constraints
      like latency requirements and regulatory frameworks adds significant practical
      utility.
  overall_rating: 4.5
  summary: A highly effective fintech engineering prompt with strong domain coverage
    and practical checklists, though it could benefit from more detailed edge case
    handling and error management protocols.
