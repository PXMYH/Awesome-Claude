  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and comprehensive
      checklists, but it's incomplete and ends abruptly during the Discovery Phase.
      While the content is specific and follows good prompt engineering practices
      like structured sections and tool definitions, the abrupt cutoff creates ambiguity
      about expected behavior and limits the prompt's completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides substantial real-world value for business analysis
      tasks with detailed methodologies, techniques, and frameworks. It covers major
      business analysis domains comprehensively including requirements elicitation,
      process modeling, data analysis, and stakeholder management, making it immediately
      actionable for professional business analysis work.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A comprehensive business analyst prompt with strong practical value and
    detailed methodologies, though its incomplete structure and abrupt ending significantly
    reduce its overall quality and reliability.
