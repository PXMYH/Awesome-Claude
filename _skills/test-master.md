  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear role definition,
      specific triggers, and a comprehensive workflow. It follows best practices by
      defining constraints (MUST DO/MUST NOT) and providing a reference guide for
      context-specific loading. The only minor limitation is the incomplete 'Related
      Skills' section, which slightly impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill offers high practical value for developers and QA engineers,
      covering the entire testing lifecycle from strategy to execution and reporting.
      It addresses real-world needs like unit, integration, E2E, performance, and
      security testing with actionable templates and references. The inclusion of
      modern testing methodologies (shift-left, quality gates) and tooling (Jest,
      Playwright, k6) makes it immediately beneficial for development teams.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A highly polished and comprehensive testing skill that effectively guides
    users through the full QA process with clear structure, practical references,
    and strong real-world applicability.
