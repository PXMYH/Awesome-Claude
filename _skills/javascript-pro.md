  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections and comprehensive
      technical specifications. However, it contains an incomplete development workflow
      section that cuts off mid-sentence, which reduces clarity and creates ambiguity
      about expected execution steps.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides exceptional real-world value with detailed checklists
      covering modern JavaScript features, performance optimization, and full-stack
      development. It offers actionable guidance for professional development tasks,
      though the incomplete workflow section limits immediate implementation.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A comprehensive JavaScript development prompt with excellent technical
    depth and practical checklists, but requires completion of the truncated workflow
    section to achieve full effectiveness.
