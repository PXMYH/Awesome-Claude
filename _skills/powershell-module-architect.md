  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured with defined
      sections for capabilities, checklists, and integration. It provides specific
      scope boundaries (PowerShell 5.1/7+, module architecture, profiles) and follows
      best practices by including example use cases and tool specifications. However,
      it lacks explicit handling of edge cases like module dependency conflicts or
      version-specific syntax errors, which would make it more robust.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill has high real-world value for PowerShell developers and
      IT operations teams managing enterprise scripts, providing actionable checklists
      and architectural patterns. It covers module design comprehensively but could
      be more practical by including concrete code examples or templates for common
      scenarios like cross-version compatibility wrappers.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured, professional prompt that effectively guides PowerShell
    module architecture with clear scope and practical checklists, though it could
    benefit from more concrete examples and edge-case handling.
