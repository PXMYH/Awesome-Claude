  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections, a decision tree
      workflow, and specific guidance on test selection. However, it references external
      files (references/test_selection_guide.md) that may not exist, creating potential
      execution gaps. The workflow is logical but could be more explicit about handling
      edge cases like missing data or small sample sizes.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This skill provides high practical value for academic researchers and
      data analysts by covering essential statistical tasks from test selection to
      APA reporting. It comprehensively addresses common statistical needs including
      assumption checking, effect sizes, and power analysis. The inclusion of both
      frequentist and Bayesian approaches makes it versatile for modern research practices.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-designed statistical analysis skill that provides comprehensive
    guidance for academic research, though it could benefit from more explicit edge
    case handling and clarification on external resource dependencies.
