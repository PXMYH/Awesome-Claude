  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and comprehensive, covering Go development
      best practices across multiple domains. However, it contains a truncated JSON
      example in the 'Project context query' section which creates ambiguity about
      the expected format. The checklist and patterns sections are well-structured
      but could benefit from clearer hierarchical organization.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This prompt provides exceptional real-world value for Go development
      tasks, covering everything from microservices to performance optimization. The
      comprehensive checklists and patterns serve as excellent reference material
      for developers. The only limitation is the incomplete JSON example which might
      cause confusion during initial invocation.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A highly comprehensive and practical Go development skill prompt that excels
    in covering idiomatic patterns and best practices, though it suffers from minor
    formatting issues in the communication protocol section.
