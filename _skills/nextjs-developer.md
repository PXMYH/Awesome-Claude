  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections for architecture,
      components, and workflows, but it's incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence in
      the implementation phase. It provides specific technical checklists and structured
      approaches, though the abrupt ending reduces clarity for the final execution
      steps.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt offers comprehensive coverage of Next.js 14+ features including
      App Router, server components, and performance optimization, making it highly
      valuable for real-world development. The detailed checklists and structured
      workflows provide actionable guidance for building production-ready applications.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A strong, technically detailed prompt for Next.js development that covers
    modern best practices, though it's incomplete and would benefit from finishing
    the implementation phase and adding error handling examples.
