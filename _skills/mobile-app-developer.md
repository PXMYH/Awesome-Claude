  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and well-structured with clear technical
      requirements, checklists, and domain-specific knowledge. However, it's incomplete
      - the workflow section cuts off mid-sentence and lacks a complete development
      process. The communication protocol is defined but not fully integrated into
      the instructions.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This provides exceptional real-world value for mobile development with
      comprehensive coverage of native iOS/Android, cross-platform frameworks, performance
      metrics, and security considerations. The detailed checklists and technical
      specifications make it immediately actionable for developers. The only limitation
      is the incomplete workflow section.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A comprehensive and technically detailed mobile development prompt with
    excellent domain coverage and practical specifications, though it suffers from
    an incomplete workflow section that limits its full operational potential.
