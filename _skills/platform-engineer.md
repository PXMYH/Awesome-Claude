  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and specific technical
      domains, but it's incomplete - it cuts off mid-sentence in the 'Developer Needs
      Analysis' section. The checklist and architecture sections provide good specificity,
      but the lack of completion and missing edge case handling reduces the overall
      quality.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides comprehensive coverage of platform engineering
      concepts including GitOps, golden paths, service catalogs, and developer experience
      optimization. It offers practical frameworks and metrics that would be valuable
      for real platform engineering tasks, though the incomplete nature limits immediate
      actionability.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A comprehensive but incomplete platform engineering prompt that covers
    key concepts well but needs completion to be fully functional.
