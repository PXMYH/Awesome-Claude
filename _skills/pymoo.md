  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, practical
      workflows, and concrete code examples. It follows excellent prompt engineering
      practices by providing context, usage guidelines, and immediate actionable examples.
      The only minor issue is the incomplete code example in the multi-objective section
      where the visualization code is cut off mid-sentence.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world scientific and engineering
      optimization tasks. It covers comprehensive use cases from single to multi-objective
      optimization, includes benchmark problems, constraint handling, and visualization.
      The workflow-based approach with specific algorithm recommendations makes it
      immediately actionable for users solving actual optimization problems.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding prompt that provides comprehensive coverage of pymoo's capabilities
    with clear, practical guidance for real-world optimization tasks, though it contains
    a minor formatting issue in one code example.
