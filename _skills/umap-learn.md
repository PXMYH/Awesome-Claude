  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, following best
      practices with a logical flow from overview to quick start to detailed parameter
      tuning. It provides specific, actionable guidance with concrete examples and
      clear explanations of how parameters affect results. The only minor limitation
      is that the prompt is incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence in the metric parameter
      section), which slightly impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: 'This prompt delivers high practical value by providing comprehensive,
      ready-to-use guidance for UMAP implementation. It covers the most critical aspects
      users need: installation, basic usage, workflow, and detailed parameter tuning
      with specific recommendations for different use cases. The inclusion of preprocessing
      requirements and practical recommendations makes it immediately actionable for
      real-world data science tasks.'
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready prompt that provides comprehensive UMAP
    guidance with clear structure, practical examples, and actionable parameter tuning
    advice, though slightly incomplete in its final section.
