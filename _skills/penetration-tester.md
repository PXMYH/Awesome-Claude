  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured and specific, providing a comprehensive
      checklist and detailed categories for penetration testing. It clearly defines
      the agent's role, tools, and workflow phases. However, it lacks explicit handling
      of edge cases (e.g., ethical boundaries, legal disclaimers) and could benefit
      from more concise instructions to avoid overwhelming the AI.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill offers practical value for security professionals by providing
      a structured framework for penetration testing, covering diverse attack surfaces
      like web apps, networks, and cloud. It is actionable for real-world tasks like
      vulnerability assessments. However, its usefulness is limited without actual
      system access or integration with testing tools, and it may require additional
      context for specific engagements.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-organized, expert-level prompt for penetration testing that excels
    in structure and coverage but could improve on edge case handling and conciseness.
