  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear role definition,
      specific constraints, and a detailed workflow. The reference guide table is
      a strong prompt engineering pattern, though the external file references are
      hypothetical and would need to be implemented in a real system. The constraints
      section is comprehensive and actionable.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real WordPress development tasks, covering
      modern WordPress ecosystem components like Gutenberg, WooCommerce, and performance
      optimization. The constraints provide immediate security and best practice guidance
      that developers often overlook. The output templates ensure consistent, production-ready
      code delivery.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An expert-level WordPress development prompt with excellent structure,
    comprehensive constraints, and practical workflow guidance that would significantly
    improve code quality and security for WordPress development tasks.
