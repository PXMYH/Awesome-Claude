  prompt_quality:
    score: 2.5
    reasoning: The prompt has structural issues and incomplete content. It starts
      with a clear framework but cuts off mid-sentence in the NIH section, leaving
      critical agency-specific guidance unfinished. The mandatory schematic requirement
      is overly prescriptive and references external tools/scripts that may not exist
      in the user's environment.
  usefulness:
    score: 3.0
    reasoning: The skill addresses a real need for grant writing assistance with specific
      agencies, and the overview provides valuable context about grant requirements.
      However, the incomplete NIH section and rigid schematic mandate reduce practical
      utility, as users cannot complete the full workflow without the missing content.
  overall_rating: 2.75
  summary: A promising but incomplete skill that needs the NIH section finished and
    the schematic requirement made optional or context-dependent to be truly functional.
