  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates strong clarity and specificity with well-structured
      workflows, clear trigger conditions, and specific reference documents. It follows
      good prompt engineering practices by defining scope, providing concrete examples,
      and establishing clear processes. However, it has a minor issue with an incomplete
      sentence at the end (Clause 8 description cuts off), which slightly impacts
      completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This skill provides high real-world value for medical device manufacturers
      navigating complex ISO 13485 certification requirements. It offers practical,
      actionable guidance through structured workflows, specific reference documents,
      and clear gap analysis processes. The inclusion of real regulatory frameworks
      (FDA QMSR, EU MDR) and specific clause references makes it immediately applicable
      for certification preparation.
  overall_rating: 4.5
  summary: A well-structured, highly practical skill that effectively addresses a
    complex regulatory documentation need with clear workflows and actionable guidance,
    though it has a minor incomplete section.
