  prompt_quality:
    score: 2.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and good organization,
      but it's incomplete and contains broken references. The 'Advanced Features'
      section cuts off mid-sentence, and all file references point to non-existent
      documentation files. While the core structure follows best practices, the incomplete
      content undermines clarity and specificity.
  usefulness:
    score: 3.0
    reasoning: The skill concept is highly valuable for microscopy researchers and
      bioinformaticians working with OMERO, covering essential workflows like data
      access, ROI management, and batch processing. However, the incomplete prompt
      limits immediate practicality since users cannot access the referenced documentation
      files. The framework itself is solid and would be very useful if completed.
  overall_rating: 2.75
  summary: A promising but incomplete skill prompt that outlines a comprehensive OMERO
    integration framework but fails to deliver complete content, making it currently
    unusable despite its strong conceptual foundation.
