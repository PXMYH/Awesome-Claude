  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured and specific, with clear sections for
      CLI architecture, argument parsing, interactive prompts, and other technical
      aspects. It follows good prompt engineering practices by providing explicit
      checklists and structured data formats. However, it's incomplete - the prompt
      cuts off mid-sentence in the UX research section, and the communication protocol
      section appears to be a placeholder rather than a fully implemented system.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This is an extremely practical and comprehensive CLI development guide
      that covers real-world concerns like startup time, memory usage, cross-platform
      compatibility, and distribution strategies. The detailed checklists and architecture
      patterns would be immediately valuable for developers building production CLI
      tools. The focus on developer experience, performance, and workflow integration
      addresses actual pain points in CLI development.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured and highly practical CLI development prompt with excellent
    technical depth, though it's incomplete and appears to be a work-in-progress template
    rather than a fully finished skill.
