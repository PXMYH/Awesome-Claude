  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, comprehensive
      documentation references, and practical examples. It follows strong prompt engineering
      practices by defining scope, providing installation steps, and including code
      snippets. The only minor limitation is that it references external documentation
      files that aren't included in the prompt itself.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for bioinformatics developers needing to deploy
      workflows on Latch. It covers real-world scenarios like RNA-seq analysis, GPU
      configuration for AlphaFold, and data management with LatchFile/LatchDir. The
      skill provides immediate actionable guidance for both beginners and experienced
      users working with bioinformatics pipelines.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, comprehensive prompt that effectively introduces the LatchBio
    platform with clear structure, practical examples, and targeted guidance for bioinformatics
    workflow development and deployment.
