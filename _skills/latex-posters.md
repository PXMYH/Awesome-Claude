  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: 'The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and specific guidance
      on LaTeX poster packages and layout principles. However, it contains a critical
      flaw: it mandates using a non-existent ''scientific-schematics'' skill and provides
      a bash command that references a script that likely doesn''t exist, creating
      confusion about actual capabilities.'
  usefulness:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The core content about LaTeX poster creation is valuable and practical
      for academic users. The detailed comparison of beamerposter, tikzposter, and
      baposter packages provides real utility. However, the mandatory requirement
      for AI-generated figures using a non-existent skill significantly undermines
      practical implementation and could frustrate users.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: This prompt provides excellent theoretical guidance on LaTeX poster creation
    but is compromised by an impossible requirement to use a non-existent 'scientific-schematics'
    skill, making it impractical for actual use without modification.
