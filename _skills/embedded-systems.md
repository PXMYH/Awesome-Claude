  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates strong domain expertise with comprehensive
      technical coverage across embedded systems topics, but lacks structural completeness
      and clear actionability. The checklist and categories are well-organized, but
      the implementation phase cuts off mid-sentence, creating ambiguity about expected
      behavior and workflow completion.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides substantial real-world value for embedded development
      tasks with detailed technical specifications and hardware constraints. It covers
      essential embedded systems domains comprehensively, though the incomplete workflow
      reduces immediate actionability for users expecting a fully defined skill.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A technically rich embedded systems prompt with strong domain coverage
    that suffers from incomplete implementation guidance, making it valuable for reference
    but requiring completion for optimal skill deployment.
