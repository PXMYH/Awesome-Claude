  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured with a strong
      design philosophy that emphasizes visual engagement and research-backed content.
      It provides specific workflows, formatting protocols, and concrete examples.
      However, it's incomplete - the critical formatting protocol section cuts off
      mid-sentence, and it references tools/scripts (generate_slide_image.py, Nano
      Banana Pro) that aren't defined within the prompt itself, creating potential
      ambiguity.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill addresses a genuine need in academic and professional settings
      where creating effective scientific presentations is time-consuming and challenging.
      It provides valuable guidance on structure, design principles, and workflow.
      However, its practicality is limited by the incomplete formatting protocol and
      dependency on unspecified external tools (Nano Banana Pro, generate_slide_image.py)
      that may not be available to all users.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-conceived skill with strong design philosophy and practical workflow
    guidance for scientific presentations, but significantly hampered by an incomplete
    prompt and unexplained tool dependencies that reduce immediate usability.
