  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with a logical
      flow from overview to quick start and core concepts. It provides specific code
      examples and defines the scope of the skill effectively, though it is slightly
      incomplete as the 'Events' section cuts off mid-sentence.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt is highly practical for real-world development tasks involving
      discrete-event simulation, such as modeling queues or resource contention. It
      provides immediate, actionable code snippets and clear guidance on when to use
      the skill versus alternatives, making it immediately beneficial for users.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A high-quality, comprehensive prompt that effectively introduces the SimPy
    skill with clear examples and practical guidance, though it contains a minor formatting
    error at the end.
