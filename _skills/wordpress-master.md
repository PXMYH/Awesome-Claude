  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and detailed, providing a comprehensive
      checklist and domain expertise areas that demonstrate clear scope and best practices
      for a WordPress architect. However, it is incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence
      in the 'Architecture Phase' section, which introduces ambiguity and lacks full
      coverage of the intended workflow.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill has high real-world value for developers needing advanced
      WordPress solutions, covering performance, security, and enterprise-scale features
      comprehensively. The actionable checklist and detailed technical areas allow
      immediate application, though the incomplete workflow section slightly reduces
      its practicality for full project execution.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A robust and expert-level prompt for WordPress development, offering deep
    technical guidance but hampered by an incomplete structure that limits its full
    potential.
