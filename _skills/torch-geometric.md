  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with a logical
      flow from installation to core concepts. It provides specific, actionable code
      examples and defines key attributes of the Data class. However, it is incomplete,
      ending abruptly during the 'Building Graph Neural Net' section, which limits
      its comprehensiveness and leaves the user without guidance on model implementation.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill is highly practical for developers working with graph data,
      offering immediate value for setup and understanding PyG's data structures.
      It covers essential use cases like molecular prediction and social networks,
      but its usefulness is reduced by the lack of model-building examples and training
      loops, which are critical for real-world application.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-crafted but incomplete prompt that provides a solid foundation for
    PyTorch Geometric but fails to deliver a complete skill due to its abrupt ending.
