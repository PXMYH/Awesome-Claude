  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides clear structure with defined sections for architecture,
      ETL, data lake, stream processing, and tools, but lacks specificity in execution
      instructions and has incomplete sections (e.g., 'Optimize perfor' is truncated).
      It follows some best practices with checklists and structured workflows, but
      edge cases and fallback guidance are not addressed.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt offers high real-world value by covering comprehensive data
      engineering domains including big data tools, cloud platforms, and orchestration
      frameworks, making it practical for pipeline development. It provides actionable
      checklists and workflows that users can apply directly to design and implement
      data platforms.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: This is a well-structured data engineering prompt with strong domain coverage
    and practical frameworks, though it suffers from minor completeness issues and
    lacks detailed execution guidance for complex scenarios.
