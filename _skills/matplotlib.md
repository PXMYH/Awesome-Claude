  description: Low-level plotting library for full customization. Use when you need
  fine-grained control over every plot element, creating novel plot types, or integrating
  with specific scientific workflows. Export to PNG/PDF/SVG for publication. For quick
  statistical plots use seaborn; for interactive plots use plotly; for publication-ready
  multi-panel figures with journal styling, use scientific-visualization.

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections, code examples, and
      a defined hierarchy. It follows good prompt engineering practices by specifying
      when to use the skill and providing both basic and advanced workflows. However,
      the prompt is incomplete (cut off mid-sentence in the 'Common Workflows' section),
      which slightly impacts clarity and completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill provides practical guidance for real-world plotting tasks,
      covering essential workflows like basic plots, subplots, and customization.
      It includes actionable code examples and best practices. The incompleteness
      limits its full utility, but the existing content is valuable for scientific
      visualization tasks.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete matplotlib skill prompt that provides
    solid foundational guidance with practical examples, though the truncated content
    reduces its overall effectiveness.
