  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and structured with clear sections for
      documentation engineering domains, but it's incomplete and contains a truncated
      'Documentation audit' section. While the communication protocol and workflow
      phases are well-defined, the abrupt ending limits clarity on execution steps.
      Best practices are partially followed with tool definitions and structured checklists.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides comprehensive coverage of documentation engineering
      domains including API docs, tutorials, automation, and testing, offering practical
      frameworks for real-world developer documentation tasks. The structured checklists
      and architecture guidelines are immediately actionable for improving documentation
      systems, though the incomplete sections reduce immediate applicability.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete documentation engineering prompt with
    strong domain coverage and practical frameworks, though execution guidance is
    truncated.
