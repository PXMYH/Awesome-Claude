  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and structured with clear sections for
      different MCP development aspects, but it's incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence
      in the workflow section. It lacks clear instructions on how to execute the workflow
      or handle the context query, making it somewhat ambiguous despite its detailed
      checklists.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides comprehensive coverage of MCP development best
      practices, security considerations, and deployment strategies, making it valuable
      for real-world development tasks. The detailed checklists and categories offer
      practical guidance, though the incomplete workflow section reduces immediate
      actionability.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete prompt that provides valuable MCP development
    guidance with strong technical depth, though execution instructions need completion
    for full practicality.
