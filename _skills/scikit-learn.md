  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections for
      overview, installation, usage guidelines, and practical examples. It follows
      best practices by providing specific code examples for common scenarios and
      defining when to use the skill. The only minor limitation is that the content
      appears truncated at the end, which slightly reduces completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate, practical value for real-world machine
      learning tasks with comprehensive coverage of scikit-learn's core capabilities.
      The inclusion of complete pipeline examples, preprocessing techniques, and clear
      guidance on algorithm selection makes it highly actionable for both beginners
      and experienced practitioners working with tabular data.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready skill prompt that provides comprehensive
    scikit-learn guidance with clear structure, practical examples, and appropriate
    scope for scientific machine learning tasks.
