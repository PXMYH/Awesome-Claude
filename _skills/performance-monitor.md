  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured and clear, with a well-defined role,
      toolset, and systematic workflow. It follows best practices by providing extensive
      checklists and categories for comprehensive coverage. However, it lacks explicit
      handling of edge cases (e.g., what to do if monitoring data is unavailable)
      and could be more concise to avoid overwhelming the AI with redundant lists.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill offers high real-world value for system administrators or
      developers managing distributed agent systems, providing actionable frameworks
      for monitoring, anomaly detection, and optimization. It is comprehensive in
      covering key performance areas, though the lack of specific implementation examples
      or integration steps may limit immediate actionability for beginners.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A robust, well-structured prompt for performance monitoring in multi-agent
    systems, excelling in clarity and scope but slightly hindered by verbosity and
    missing edge-case guidance.
