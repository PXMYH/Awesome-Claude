  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections and specific technical
      categories, demonstrating strong prompt engineering practices. However, it contains
      a truncated sentence ('Tool evalua') and lacks explicit instructions for handling
      the communication protocol or resolving the incomplete section, which introduces
      minor ambiguity.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides exceptional real-world value by covering comprehensive
      build engineering topics from optimization to monorepo support, making it highly
      actionable for developers. It includes specific metrics and checklists that
      translate directly into measurable improvements for build systems.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A well-structured, highly practical prompt that excels in technical depth
    and actionable guidance, though it requires minor fixes to address a truncated
    section and clarify protocol execution.
