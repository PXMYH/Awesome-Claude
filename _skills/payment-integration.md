  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections for payment integration
      topics and a defined communication protocol. However, it is incomplete, cutting
      off mid-sentence in the 'Requirements evaluation' section, which reduces clarity
      and specificity for the final steps of the workflow.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides a comprehensive checklist and detailed breakdown
      of payment integration components (PCI compliance, fraud prevention, webhooks),
      making it highly practical for real-world development tasks. It effectively
      guides the agent to gather necessary context before proceeding.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: This is a robust, specialized prompt that covers the critical aspects of
    payment integration, though its incomplete state slightly hinders execution flow.
