  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and practical examples,
      but it's incomplete - the Export Options section cuts off mid-sentence. The
      content is generally clear and follows good prompt engineering practices with
      logical flow from quick start to advanced topics. However, the truncation creates
      ambiguity about what the full skill should contain.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides high practical value for data visualization tasks,
      covering both beginner and advanced use cases with concrete code examples. It
      effectively distinguishes between Plotly Express and Graph Objects APIs, which
      is crucial for users. The inclusion of specific chart types, styling options,
      and interactivity features makes it immediately actionable for real-world development.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A solid visualization skill prompt with excellent practical guidance and
    clear API distinctions, but significantly undermined by being incomplete - the
    export section cuts off mid-sentence, suggesting missing content that would be
    essential for a complete skill.
