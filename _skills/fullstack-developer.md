  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured and specific, providing clear checklists
      and architecture patterns. It follows good prompt engineering practices by defining
      a clear role, workflow, and communication protocol. However, the prompt is cut
      off mid-sentence in the 'Implementation Workflow' section, which introduces
      ambiguity about the complete instructions.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This skill provides immense practical value for full-stack development
      tasks, covering comprehensive aspects from database to deployment. The detailed
      checklists and architecture considerations offer actionable guidance for real-world
      scenarios. The only limitation is the incomplete prompt, which may affect execution
      of the full workflow.
  overall_rating: 4.5
  summary: A well-structured and comprehensive full-stack development prompt that
    provides excellent guidance across the entire stack, though it is unfortunately
    cut off mid-sentence, slightly reducing its completeness.
