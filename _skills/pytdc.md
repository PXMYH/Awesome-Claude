  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides clear installation instructions and basic usage
      patterns with code examples, but lacks depth in edge case handling and best
      practices. The structure is logical with overview, when-to-use, and quick start
      sections, but the incomplete 'Other Single Prediction Tasks' section and missing
      completion of the prompt content reduces overall clarity and specificity.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill offers high practical value for drug discovery and therapeutic
      ML tasks, providing concrete examples for ADME and toxicity predictions that
      users can immediately apply. The inclusion of specific dataset names and split
      methods makes it actionable for real-world pharmaceutical research, though the
      incomplete content limits its full potential.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A useful but incomplete skill prompt for PyTDC that provides practical
    drug discovery datasets and benchmarks, though it needs completion of the 'Other
    Single Prediction Tasks' section and better edge case handling to reach its full
    potential.
