  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, comprehensive
      documentation, and practical code examples. It follows excellent prompt engineering
      practices by providing context, design philosophy, and specific use cases. The
      only minor issue is the incomplete 'displot()' example in the Distribution Plots
      section, which slightly affects completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides immediate practical value for data scientists
      and analysts working with statistical visualization. It covers both traditional
      and modern seaborn interfaces, includes real-world examples, and addresses common
      use cases like exploratory analysis and publication-quality figures. The comprehensive
      coverage of plot types and parameters makes it highly actionable.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding prompt that effectively teaches seaborn statistical visualization
    with clear structure, practical examples, and comprehensive coverage of both traditional
    and modern interfaces, making it immediately useful for real-world data analysis
    tasks.
