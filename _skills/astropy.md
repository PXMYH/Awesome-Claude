  description: Comprehensive Python library for astronomy and astrophysics. This skill
  should be used when working with astronomical data including celestial coordinates,
  physical units, FITS files, cosmological calculations, time systems, tables, world
  coordinate systems (WCS), and astronomical data analysis. Use when tasks involve
  coordinate transformations, unit conversions, FITS file manipulation, cosmological
  distance calculations, time scale conversions, or astronomical dat...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with a comprehensive
      overview, specific 'When to Use' guidance, and practical quick-start examples.
      It follows excellent prompt engineering practices by defining scope, capabilities,
      and providing concrete code snippets. The only minor limitation is that it references
      external documentation files that may not be available in all contexts.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill prompt is highly practical and valuable for real-world astronomical
      data analysis tasks. It covers the most essential astropy functionalities comprehensively,
      from coordinate transformations to FITS file handling and cosmological calculations.
      The quick-start examples provide immediate actionable code that users can adapt
      directly for their work.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready skill prompt that effectively captures astropy's
    core capabilities with clear guidance, practical examples, and comprehensive coverage
    of astronomical data analysis needs.
