  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear role definition, workflow,
      and constraints. It follows good prompt engineering practices with specific
      triggers, output templates, and reference guides. However, it assumes external
      reference files exist which may not be available, and the 'three perspectives'
      framework, while clear, could be more explicitly defined for edge cases like
      mobile-first or serverless architectures.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill provides practical value for full-stack development tasks
      by enforcing security-first thinking and comprehensive implementation planning.
      It covers real-world concerns like authentication, validation, and cross-stack
      data flows. The main limitation is the dependency on external reference files
      that may not exist in all contexts, reducing immediate actionability.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured, security-focused full-stack development skill with strong
    workflow guidance, though its effectiveness depends on access to referenced documentation
    files.
