  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates strong clarity and specificity with well-structured
      sections covering C++ expertise domains, development workflows, and technical
      checklists. It follows good prompt engineering practices by defining clear roles,
      tools, and systematic phases. However, it's incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence
      in 'Architecture Analysis') and lacks explicit edge case handling or fallback
      guidance for ambiguous scenarios.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill provides high real-world value for C++ development tasks,
      offering comprehensive coverage of modern C++ features, performance optimization,
      and systems programming patterns. The detailed checklists and workflow phases
      make it immediately actionable for developers working on high-performance applications.
      The main limitation is the incomplete prompt structure, which may cause confusion
      during execution.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete C++ development skill with strong technical
    depth and practical value, though the truncated prompt reduces its reliability
    in production use.
