  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, comprehensive
      code examples, and a logical flow from fundamentals to advanced topics. It effectively
      uses tables and code blocks to explain complex concepts like abilities and generics.
      However, it's incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence in the Coin Standard section),
      which prevents a perfect score.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides immediate, practical value for developers working
      with Aptos and Move, covering essential topics from language fundamentals to
      framework usage. The inclusion of specific code examples, gas optimization guidance,
      and dApp integration makes it highly actionable for real-world development tasks.
      The comprehensive coverage of token standards and the object model addresses
      current industry needs.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready prompt that comprehensively covers Aptos
    blockchain development with Move, though it appears to be truncated and missing
    the complete Coin Standard section.
