prompt_preview: "---\nname: pufferlib\ndescription: High-performance reinforcement\
  \ learning framework optimized for speed and scale. Use when you need fast parallel\
  \ training, vectorized environments, multi-agent systems, or integration with game\
  \ environments (Atari, Procgen, NetHack). Achieves 2-10x speedups over standard\
  \ implementations. For quick prototyping or standard algorithm implementations with\
  \ extensive documentation, use stable-baselines3 instead.\nlicense: MIT license\n\

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections and practical code
      examples. It effectively defines the skill's scope, capabilities, and usage
      context. The only minor weakness is that the environment development section
      is cut off mid-sentence, which slightly impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate, actionable value for RL practitioners
      needing high-performance training. It covers real-world use cases like multi-agent
      systems and integration with popular environments. The inclusion of both CLI
      and Python APIs makes it accessible for different workflows.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A well-crafted, highly practical skill prompt that effectively communicates
    a specialized RL framework's capabilities with clear usage guidance and concrete
    examples.
