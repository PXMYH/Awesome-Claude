  description: Comprehensive toolkit for survival analysis and time-to-event modeling
  in Python using scikit-survival. Use this skill when working with censored survival
  data, performing time-to-event analysis, fitting Cox models, Random Survival Forests,
  Gradient Boosting models, or Survival SVMs, evaluating survival predictions with
  concordance index or Brier score, handling competing risks, or implementing any
  survival analysis workflow with the scikit-survival library...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, comprehensive
      coverage of model types, and a helpful decision tree for model selection. It
      provides specific guidance on when to use each model family and references to
      detailed documentation. The only minor limitation is that the decision tree
      is incomplete (ends abruptly at 'For maximum performance → T'), which slightly
      impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is a highly practical and valuable skill for anyone working with
      survival analysis in Python. It covers the full spectrum of scikit-survival
      capabilities from basic Cox models to advanced ensemble methods and SVMs, with
      clear guidance on model selection based on data characteristics. The inclusion
      of evaluation metrics, competing risks, and preprocessing considerations makes
      it immediately actionable for real-world survival analysis tasks.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, comprehensive survival analysis skill that provides clear
    guidance on model selection and usage across the scikit-survival ecosystem, with
    only a minor formatting issue in the decision tree.
