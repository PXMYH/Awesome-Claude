  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and specific technical
      requirements, but it lacks complete implementation details in the workflow section.
      The checklist and feature lists are comprehensive, but the actual execution
      instructions are incomplete, which reduces clarity for the AI agent.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides excellent technical coverage of modern .NET development
      with comprehensive checklists for quality assurance. It would be highly valuable
      for developers working on enterprise .NET applications, though the incomplete
      workflow section limits immediate actionability.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A technically comprehensive .NET expert prompt with strong architectural
    guidance and quality checklists, but needs completion of the implementation workflow
    section to reach full effectiveness.
