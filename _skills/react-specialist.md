  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and comprehensive
      checklists covering React 18+ features, patterns, and best practices. However,
      it contains some ambiguity in the workflow section (e.g., 'Configure build too'
      appears incomplete) and the communication protocol references a context manager
      that isn't clearly defined or integrated into the actual execution flow.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This prompt provides exceptional real-world value for React development,
      covering modern patterns, performance optimization, state management, and testing
      strategies comprehensively. The detailed checklists and pattern references serve
      as excellent guidance for production-ready applications, though the workflow
      execution could be more concrete for immediate actionability.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A highly comprehensive and well-organized React specialist prompt that
    excels in covering modern React ecosystem and best practices, though it has minor
    execution flow ambiguities that slightly reduce its immediate actionability.
