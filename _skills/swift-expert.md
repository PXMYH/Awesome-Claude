  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and well-structured, clearly defining
      the agent's expertise, tools, and development workflow. It includes comprehensive
      checklists and patterns for modern Swift development, though the workflow section
      is cut off mid-sentence, which slightly impacts clarity and completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides significant real-world value for Swift developers
      by covering a wide range of modern practices, from SwiftUI to server-side Swift.
      It is actionable for complex projects, but the incomplete workflow section and
      lack of explicit user interaction guidelines reduce its immediate practicality
      for end-users.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A strong, expert-level prompt with deep technical specificity that is highly
    useful for Swift development tasks, though it is slightly hampered by an incomplete
    workflow section and could benefit from clearer user guidance.
