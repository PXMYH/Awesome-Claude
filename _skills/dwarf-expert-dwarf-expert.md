  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates excellent clarity and specificity with well-defined
      scope, clear trigger conditions, and authoritative source guidance. It follows
      strong prompt engineering practices by including explicit 'When to Use' and
      'When NOT to Use' sections, though it's incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence in
      the 'Working With Code' section).
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill provides high practical value for developers working with
      DWARF debug information, offering concrete verification workflows and tool recommendations.
      The inclusion of specific command examples and authoritative sources makes it
      immediately actionable, though the incomplete prompt reduces its immediate usability.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured, technically detailed prompt for DWARF expertise that
    would be highly valuable for debugging and development workflows, but requires
    completion of the truncated content to reach full potential.
