  description: Structured manuscript/grant review with checklist-based evaluation.
  Use when writing formal peer reviews with specific criteria methodology assessment,
  statistical validity, reporting standards compliance (CONSORT/STROBE), and constructive
  feedback. Best for actual review writing, manuscript revision. For evaluating claims/evidence
  quality use scientific-critical-thinking; for quantitative scoring frameworks use
  scholar-evaluation.

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and specific guidance
      on when to use the skill. However, it's incomplete - the content cuts off mid-sentence
      in the 'Abstract and Title' section, leaving the detailed review criteria unfinished.
      The instructions for generating schematics are clear but may be overly prescriptive
      about tool usage.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: Highly practical for real-world scientific peer review tasks with comprehensive
      workflow stages and specific evaluation criteria. The inclusion of reporting
      standards (CONSORT, STROBE, PRISMA) adds significant value. The visual enhancement
      recommendation for schematics is innovative and useful for complex scientific
      communication.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A strong, practical peer review skill with excellent structure and real-world
    applicability, though the prompt is incomplete and would benefit from finishing
    the detailed review criteria sections.
