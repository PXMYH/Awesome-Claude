  ## Overview


  Help turn ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative
  dialogue.


  Start by understanding the current project context, then ask questions one at a

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections and specific guidance.
      It defines a clear process flow and includes concrete constraints like word
      limits and question frequency. However, it lacks explicit handling for edge
      cases like ambiguous user input or when the user wants to skip brainstorming.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill addresses a critical gap in AI-assisted development by enforcing
      design thinking before implementation. The step-by-step process with validation
      loops ensures thorough planning, reducing costly rework later. The integration
      with documentation and implementation workflows makes it immediately actionable
      for real projects.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A well-structured prompt that effectively enforces a disciplined design-first
    approach to development, though it could benefit from more explicit edge case
    handling.
