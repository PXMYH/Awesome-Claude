  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured with explicit
      patterns, forbidden responses, and concrete examples. It handles edge cases
      like unclear feedback and external reviewers comprehensively. The only minor
      issue is the incomplete example at the end ('❌ "You're absolutely r'), which
      slightly reduces clarity.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This provides immense practical value for developers receiving code
      reviews, addressing common pitfalls like performative agreement and blind implementation.
      It offers actionable frameworks for verification, pushback, and handling unclear
      feedback that directly improve code quality and team communication.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding, highly practical prompt that transforms code review reception
    from a social performance into a rigorous technical process, with exceptional
    clarity and comprehensive coverage of real-world scenarios.
