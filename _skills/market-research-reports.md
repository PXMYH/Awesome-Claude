  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections, specific tool
      usage examples, and defined output formats. It follows best practices by explicitly
      stating the skill's purpose, scope, and visual requirements. However, it lacks
      explicit handling for edge cases like missing data or API failures, and the
      visual generation examples are specific to a hypothetical environment that may
      not exist.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill addresses a real-world need for comprehensive market analysis
      with professional formatting, offering practical value for business strategy
      and investment decisions. It provides actionable frameworks and visual generation
      guidance, but its usefulness is limited by dependency on specific tools (e.g.,
      'scientific-schematics') that may not be universally available or implemented.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured and detailed prompt for generating professional market
    research reports, though it assumes specific tooling that may not be accessible
    in all environments.
