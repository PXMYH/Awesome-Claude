  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and well-structured with clear categories
      covering enterprise Java development comprehensively. However, it's truncated
      at the end (incomplete JSON query example), which creates ambiguity about the
      communication protocol implementation. The checklist format is excellent but
      could benefit from more explicit action instructions.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This provides exceptional value for enterprise Java development with
      thorough coverage of modern practices, Spring ecosystem, and microservices patterns.
      The comprehensive checklists and patterns serve as excellent reference material
      for real-world development tasks. The only limitation is the incomplete communication
      protocol which may cause implementation issues.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A robust, enterprise-focused Java architect prompt with excellent depth
    in modern Java practices and Spring ecosystem, though slightly hampered by incomplete
    communication protocol specification.
