  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates strong structure with clear sections and comprehensive
      checklists for various UX research methodologies. However, it's incomplete -
      the Development Workflow section cuts off mid-sentence and lacks full implementation
      details. The communication protocol is defined but not fully integrated into
      the execution flow.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides excellent practical value with detailed checklists
      covering major UX research activities including interviews, usability testing,
      surveys, analytics, personas, journey mapping, and competitive analysis. The
      structured approach with specific methodologies and validation criteria makes
      it immediately actionable for real UX research tasks.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured UX research prompt with comprehensive methodology checklists
    and practical frameworks, though incomplete in its execution workflow and missing
    some implementation details.
