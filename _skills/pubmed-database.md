  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, specific
      examples, and practical guidance. It provides concrete query syntax and field
      tag references that are immediately actionable. The only minor limitation is
      the truncated example query at the end, which slightly reduces completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill has high real-world value for researchers, clinicians, and
      developers working with biomedical literature. It covers comprehensive search
      strategies, MeSH terminology, and API access patterns that directly address
      common literature review and data extraction tasks. The inclusion of specific
      syntax examples and field tags makes it immediately practical for systematic
      reviews and automated workflows.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A highly practical and well-structured skill prompt that provides comprehensive
    guidance for PubMed database interactions, with strong technical specificity and
    real-world applicability for biomedical research workflows.
