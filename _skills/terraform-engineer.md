  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides a comprehensive structure with clear categories
      and checklists for Terraform engineering, but it's incomplete and ends abruptly
      mid-sentence. While the framework is well-organized and specific about Terraform
      best practices, the lack of completion and the abrupt ending reduce clarity
      and make it difficult to evaluate the full scope of instructions.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt offers high practical value for Terraform development with
      detailed checklists covering module development, state management, security,
      and enterprise patterns. The structured approach with specific metrics (like
      80% reusability) and comprehensive coverage of multi-cloud scenarios makes it
      immediately actionable for infrastructure engineering tasks.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete Terraform engineering prompt that provides
    excellent practical frameworks and checklists, though its abrupt ending and lack
    of completion limit its full effectiveness.
