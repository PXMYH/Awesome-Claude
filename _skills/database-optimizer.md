  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and structured, providing a clear checklist
      and detailed categories for database optimization. However, it is incomplete,
      cutting off mid-sentence in the 'Implementation Phase' section, which introduces
      ambiguity and lacks a defined conclusion or final instructions.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill offers comprehensive coverage of database optimization topics,
      including specific metrics and strategies for multiple database systems, making
      it highly practical for real-world performance tuning tasks. The structured
      checklist and categories provide actionable guidance for users.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A detailed and practical database optimization skill that is let down by
    an incomplete prompt structure, though its content remains valuable for performance
    tuning tasks.
