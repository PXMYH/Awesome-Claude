  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates strong specificity with comprehensive checklists
      covering Flutter 3+ features, architecture patterns, and performance metrics.
      However, it lacks clarity in execution instructions and edge case handling,
      as the development workflow is incomplete and the communication protocol is
      not fully defined. The structure is organized but the abrupt ending and missing
      implementation details reduce overall coherence.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill provides high real-world value for Flutter developers by
      covering essential topics like state management, platform integration, and performance
      optimization. The comprehensive checklists and architecture patterns offer practical
      guidance for building production-ready applications. While incomplete, the existing
      content is actionable and addresses key development challenges in cross-platform
      mobile development.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured Flutter expert prompt with excellent technical depth
    and practical checklists, though incomplete execution guidance and missing workflow
    details prevent it from achieving maximum effectiveness.
