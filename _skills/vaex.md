  description: Use this skill for processing and analyzing large tabular datasets
  (billions of rows) that exceed available RAM. Vaex excels at out-of-core DataFrame
  operations, lazy evaluation, fast aggregations, efficient visualization of big data,
  and machine learning on large datasets. Apply when users need to work with large
  CSV/HDF5/Arrow/Parquet files, perform fast statistics on massive datasets, create
  visualizations of big data, or build ML pipelines that do not fit in memor...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections for
      overview, usage guidelines, and core capabilities. It follows excellent prompt
      engineering practices by providing specific reference paths and a quick-start
      pattern. However, it's incomplete—the Quick Start Pattern cuts off mid-sentence,
      which slightly undermines the otherwise excellent clarity and completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt demonstrates high practical value by addressing a real-world
      problem (large dataset processing) with specific, actionable guidance. It comprehensively
      covers Vaex's six primary capability areas and provides concrete use cases (astronomical
      data, financial time series) that help users immediately identify when to apply
      the skill. The reference-based structure enables users to dive deep into specific
      topics as needed.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding skill prompt that excels in structure, specificity, and
    practical utility, though it suffers from an incomplete quick-start example that
    should be completed for optimal effectiveness.
