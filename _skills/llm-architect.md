  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: 'The prompt demonstrates strong clarity and specificity with well-structured
      sections covering LLM architecture, fine-tuning, RAG, and serving patterns.
      It follows best practices by including checklists and systematic workflows.
      However, it has a significant gap: the workflow section is incomplete (ends
      abruptly at ''Implementation''), and the communication protocol references a
      context manager that isn''t defined or implemented in the prompt.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides comprehensive coverage of LLM system design topics
      with practical checklists and architectural patterns that would benefit developers
      building production LLM applications. It offers real-world value through structured
      approaches to optimization, safety, and deployment. The main limitation is the
      incomplete workflow, which reduces immediate actionability for users expecting
      a complete implementation guide.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete LLM architect prompt that excels in technical
    depth and organization but needs completion of the workflow section and clarification
    of the communication protocol to be fully actionable.
