  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear role definition,
      specific triggers, and comprehensive constraints. It follows best practices
      by defining a core workflow and providing reference guidance. However, it references
      external files (references/*.md) that may not exist, which could cause issues
      in practice.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill addresses a critical need in modern software development
      with high practical value. It covers the full observability stack comprehensively
      from logging to alerting, making it immediately actionable for developers and
      SREs. The inclusion of specific tools and methodologies (Prometheus, Grafana,
      RED/USE) makes it highly applicable to real-world scenarios.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready monitoring skill that provides comprehensive
    observability guidance with strong practical value, though it depends on external
    reference files that may need to be created or integrated.
