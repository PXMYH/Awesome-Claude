  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.0
    reasoning: The prompt has good structure with clear sections and specific checklists,
      but it's incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence in 'Team health check') and lacks
      concrete instructions for tool usage. The communication protocol is defined
      but not fully integrated into the workflow, and there's no guidance on how to
      handle the truncated content or missing sections.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides comprehensive Scrum Master frameworks covering
      all key ceremonies and metrics, making it highly practical for agile teams.
      The detailed checklists and structured approach offer immediate value for facilitation
      and improvement activities, though the incomplete sections limit full implementation.
  overall_rating: 3.5
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete Scrum Master prompt with strong framework
    coverage that needs completion and better tool integration to reach its full potential.
