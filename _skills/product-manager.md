  prompt_quality:
    score: 2.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides a comprehensive list of product management concepts
      and frameworks, but lacks clear instructions for the agent's actual execution.
      The development workflow is incomplete (ends abruptly with 'T'), and there's
      no guidance on how to use the listed tools or handle specific user queries.
      The structure is more of a knowledge repository than an actionable agent prompt.
  usefulness:
    score: 2.0
    reasoning: While the prompt contains valuable product management knowledge, it's
      not practically useful as an agent skill because it doesn't define how the agent
      should respond to user requests. The checklist and frameworks are informative
      but don't translate into actionable workflows for the agent to follow when users
      ask for help with product management tasks.
  overall_rating: 2.25
  summary: This prompt serves better as a reference guide than an operational agent
    skill, as it lacks clear execution instructions, complete workflows, and specific
    response protocols for user interactions.
