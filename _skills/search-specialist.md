  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates excellent structure and clarity with well-organized
      sections covering search methodologies, quality assessment, and specialized
      domains. However, it lacks specific edge case handling (e.g., what to do when
      no results are found, how to handle conflicting information sources) and the
      communication protocol section is incomplete, which could lead to ambiguity
      in execution.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides comprehensive coverage of search specialist competencies
      and would be valuable for research-intensive tasks, offering practical frameworks
      for query optimization and result curation. However, the incomplete development
      workflow and missing concrete examples reduce immediate actionability, requiring
      users to fill in implementation gaps.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured, domain-expert prompt with strong theoretical foundations
    in information retrieval, but needs completion of workflow sections and edge case
    guidance to reach full practical utility.
