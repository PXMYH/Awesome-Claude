  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, comprehensive
      capability breakdowns, and specific reference pointers. It follows best practices
      by defining scope, use cases, and authentication requirements. However, it references
      external documentation files that may not exist, creating a potential dependency
      issue.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill provides high practical value for scientific researchers
      and lab managers who need programmatic access to protocols.io. The coverage
      of authentication, protocol lifecycle, collaboration, and workspace management
      addresses real-world scientific workflows. The main limitation is the dependency
      on external reference files that may not be available.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured, comprehensive scientific integration skill with excellent
    organization and clear use cases, though it has a dependency on external documentation
    that may limit immediate usability.
