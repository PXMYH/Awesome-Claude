  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with a logical
      flow from overview to installation and core capabilities. It provides specific
      code examples and references to detailed documentation, demonstrating strong
      specificity. However, it is incomplete (cut off mid-sentence in the 'Core Capabilities'
      section), which prevents a perfect score as it lacks full edge case handling
      and best practice coverage.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This prompt offers high real-world value for digital pathology tasks,
      providing actionable code for slide processing, tissue detection, and tile extraction.
      It comprehensively covers basic workflows and key classes, making it immediately
      beneficial for dataset preparation and simple analysis. The utility is slightly
      limited by its incompleteness, as advanced users would need to seek external
      resources for the full scope.
  overall_rating: 4.5
  summary: A high-quality, practical prompt for basic whole slide image processing
    that is clear and actionable, though its incomplete state prevents a top score.
