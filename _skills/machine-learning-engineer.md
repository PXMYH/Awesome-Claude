  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured and specific, providing extensive checklists
      and technical categories for ML engineering tasks. However, it is incomplete
      (cut off mid-sentence in the Implementation Phase) and lacks clear instructions
      on how to use the provided tools or interact with the context manager, which
      reduces clarity and actionable guidance.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt offers comprehensive coverage of ML deployment topics, including
      optimization, serving infrastructure, and scaling strategies, which provides
      high real-world value for production ML systems. It is actionable for users
      needing to design or audit ML pipelines, though the incomplete sections limit
      its immediate usability.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A detailed and technically robust prompt for ML engineering that excels
    in scope and specificity but is hampered by an incomplete structure and missing
    tool usage instructions.
