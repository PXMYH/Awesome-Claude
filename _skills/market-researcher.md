  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections for market analysis,
      consumer research, and competitive intelligence, providing a comprehensive checklist
      of deliverables. However, it lacks specific instructions for handling edge cases
      like missing data or conflicting sources, and the workflow section is incomplete,
      which reduces clarity and specificity.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill offers high practical value for real-world market research
      tasks, covering essential methodologies, data collection techniques, and strategic
      insights that can directly inform business decisions. It is actionable for users
      needing structured market analysis, though the incomplete workflow may require
      additional guidance for full implementation.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: This market researcher prompt is a robust framework for comprehensive market
    analysis with strong practical utility, but it needs refinement in edge case handling
    and workflow completion to achieve optimal clarity.
