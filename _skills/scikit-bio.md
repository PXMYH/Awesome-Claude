  prompt_quality:
    score: 2.5
    reasoning: The prompt has significant quality issues. It is incomplete, ending
      abruptly in the middle of a code example within the 'Phylogenetic Trees' section.
      The structure is inconsistent, with some sections having detailed code examples
      and others being cut short. This incompleteness makes the prompt unreliable
      and confusing for the user.
  usefulness:
    score: 3.0
    reasoning: Despite the quality issues, the prompt outlines a highly relevant and
      useful skill for bioinformatics and microbiome analysis. It correctly identifies
      key capabilities like sequence manipulation, alignment, and phylogenetics. However,
      the incomplete nature of the prompt severely limits its immediate practicality,
      as users cannot rely on the full instructions provided.
  overall_rating: 2.75
  summary: The prompt describes a valuable scientific skill but is critically flawed
    due to being incomplete, which undermines its reliability and usability.
