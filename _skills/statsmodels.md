  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: 'The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, comprehensive
      examples, and specific guidance on when to use the skill. It follows best practices
      by including metadata, license information, and practical code snippets. However,
      there''s a minor issue: the ARIMA example is incomplete (cut off mid-line with
      `results.get_f`), which slightly impacts clarity and completeness.'
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides immediate, real-world value with production-ready
      code examples covering OLS, logistic regression, and time series analysis. It
      includes essential diagnostics, visualization, and model evaluation techniques
      that are directly applicable to statistical analysis tasks. The comprehensive
      coverage of statistical methods and econometrics makes it highly practical for
      researchers and data scientists.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A high-quality, comprehensive prompt that provides excellent practical
    value for statistical modeling tasks, with only a minor formatting issue in the
    ARIMA example that doesn't significantly impact overall utility.
