  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured and specific, with clear sections for
      different data analysis domains and a defined communication protocol. However,
      it is incomplete (cut off mid-sentence in the 'Requirements Analysis' section)
      and lacks explicit instructions for handling edge cases or fallback scenarios,
      which limits its robustness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides a comprehensive framework for data analysis tasks,
      covering essential areas like SQL optimization, dashboard development, and stakeholder
      communication, making it highly practical for real-world business intelligence
      work. The inclusion of specific tools and methodologies adds immediate value
      for users seeking structured guidance.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: This is a well-structured but incomplete data analyst prompt that offers
    strong practical value for business intelligence tasks, though it needs completion
    and edge-case handling to reach its full potential.
