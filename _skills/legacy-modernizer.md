  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear categories and comprehensive
      checklists, but it lacks specific instructions for tool usage and has an incomplete
      development workflow section. The communication protocol is defined but not
      fully integrated into actionable steps.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides valuable frameworks for legacy modernization with
      extensive checklists covering assessment, migration strategies, and risk mitigation.
      It offers practical patterns and strategies that would be immediately applicable
      to real-world legacy system modernization projects.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A comprehensive legacy modernization framework with strong conceptual coverage,
    though incomplete in execution details and tool integration.
