  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear installation
      instructions, practical code examples, and logical organization by capability.
      It follows best practices by including metadata, license information, and explicit
      guidance on when to use Cirq versus other frameworks. The only minor limitation
      is that some references point to non-existent internal files (e.g., references/building.md),
      which could confuse users expecting those resources.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for quantum computing developers targeting
      Google hardware or needing noise-aware circuit design. The prompt provides immediate
      value with runnable code examples covering basic circuits, parameterized circuits,
      and hardware integration. It comprehensively addresses the core use cases for
      Cirq while clearly delineating its scope compared to other quantum frameworks.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready skill prompt that provides comprehensive
    guidance for Cirq quantum computing with clear examples, proper scope definition,
    and practical installation instructions for various hardware providers.
