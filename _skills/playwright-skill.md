  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and specific, with well-defined workflows,
      explicit path resolution instructions, and concrete code examples. It follows
      best practices by providing fallback guidance for edge cases like multiple servers
      or no servers found. The only minor weakness is the incomplete code snippet
      in the 'Common Patterns' section, which cuts off mid-example.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate, practical value for web development
      and testing tasks. It covers comprehensive browser automation scenarios including
      responsive testing, form filling, login flows, and screenshot capture. The auto-detection
      of dev servers and /tmp file management make it highly actionable for real-world
      development workflows.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A well-structured, highly practical browser automation skill with excellent
    clarity and comprehensive coverage of common testing scenarios, though slightly
    hampered by an incomplete code example.
