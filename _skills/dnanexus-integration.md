  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and a logical organization
      of capabilities, making it easy to understand the scope. However, it is incomplete
      (cut off mid-sentence in the Python SDK section) and lacks specific instructions
      for the AI's behavior, such as how to handle missing reference files or user
      queries outside the defined scope.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The skill provides high practical value for developers working with
      the DNAnexus platform, covering essential operations like app development, data
      management, and job execution with specific commands and use cases. It is actionable
      for users with a DNAnexus account, though its utility is limited by the incomplete
      content and the requirement for external reference documentation.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: This is a valuable, domain-specific skill for genomics cloud platform development,
    but its effectiveness is hampered by an incomplete prompt and reliance on external
    references.
