  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections for
      context, checklists, and workflows. It follows best practices by defining specific
      technical requirements (F1 > 0.85, latency < 100ms) and comprehensive task categories.
      The only minor issue is the incomplete 'Technical evaluation' section at the
      end, which cuts off abruptly.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides substantial real-world value for NLP engineering
      tasks, covering major domains like NER, classification, translation, and conversational
      AI. The systematic workflow and checklists make it actionable for production
      systems. However, the utility is slightly limited by the incomplete final section
      and the lack of concrete implementation examples.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A comprehensive, well-structured NLP engineering prompt that excels in
    organization and technical specificity, though slightly hampered by an incomplete
    section and missing practical examples.
