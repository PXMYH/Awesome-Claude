  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections for code smells,
      refactoring patterns, and safety practices, providing excellent specificity.
      It follows prompt engineering best practices by defining a role, workflow, and
      checklist, though the workflow section is cut off mid-sentence, slightly reducing
      clarity.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill offers high real-world value for developers tackling legacy
      code or complexity, with comprehensive coverage of refactoring techniques and
      safety measures. However, the abrupt end to the workflow section limits immediate
      actionability, as users may lack guidance on executing the final steps.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A robust, expert-level refactoring prompt with strong structure and practical
    depth, though incomplete workflow guidance slightly hampers usability.
