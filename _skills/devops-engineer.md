  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and a comprehensive
      checklist covering key DevOps domains, providing good specificity. However,
      it is incomplete (cutting off mid-sentence in the 'Development Workflow' section)
      and lacks explicit instructions on how to use the tools or handle edge cases,
      which limits its clarity and completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt offers high practical value by outlining a systematic approach
      to DevOps transformation, including maturity analysis and actionable checklists
      for infrastructure, CI/CD, and monitoring. It is comprehensive for real-world
      tasks like assessing and improving automation, though the incomplete workflow
      section reduces immediate actionability for users.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: This is a strong, domain-specific prompt with valuable DevOps frameworks,
    but its incomplete state and lack of tool usage guidance prevent it from being
    fully polished.
