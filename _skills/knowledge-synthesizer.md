  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates strong structural organization with clear sections
      and a detailed checklist system, but suffers from significant incompleteness.
      The development workflow section is abruptly cut off mid-sentence, and several
      key areas lack concrete implementation details. While the knowledge extraction
      pipelines and pattern recognition systems are well-defined, the prompt doesn't
      provide specific tool usage instructions or clear execution steps.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The concept addresses a valuable need for multi-agent system orchestration
      and knowledge management, with comprehensive coverage of synthesis areas. The
      detailed checklists and categorization provide a solid framework for systematic
      knowledge extraction and improvement tracking. However, the incomplete prompt
      structure limits immediate practical application, requiring users to fill in
      significant gaps before deployment.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-conceptualized but incomplete knowledge synthesis framework that
    shows promise for multi-agent system improvement but requires completion and more
    concrete implementation guidance to be fully operational.
