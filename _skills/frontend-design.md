  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and clear, providing a strong conceptual
      framework with explicit aesthetic guidelines and anti-pattern warnings (e.g.,
      avoiding 'AI slop'). It defines scope well but could be slightly more explicit
      on technical edge cases like accessibility or performance constraints.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill is highly practical for developers seeking creative, production-ready
      UI code, offering actionable design thinking and aesthetic direction. It covers
      a broad range of frontend tasks comprehensively, though its focus on bold aesthetics
      may not suit all real-world projects requiring strict brand guidelines.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-crafted, creative prompt that excels in guiding distinctive frontend
    design with strong practical value, though it could benefit from more explicit
    handling of technical edge cases.
