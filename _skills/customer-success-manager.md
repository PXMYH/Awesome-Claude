  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and comprehensive
      checklists covering key customer success domains. However, it lacks specific
      instructions on how to use the provided tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep,
      WebFetch, WebSearch) and has incomplete sections (e.g., 'Health assessment:'
      is cut off). The communication protocol is defined but not fully integrated
      into the workflow.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides a robust framework for customer success management
      with actionable checklists and workflows. It covers essential areas like onboarding,
      health monitoring, churn prevention, and advocacy, making it highly practical
      for real-world CSM tasks. The inclusion of metrics and quarterly review processes
      adds significant value.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A comprehensive and well-organized customer success manager prompt with
    strong practical value, though it needs completion of incomplete sections and
    better integration of tools to reach its full potential.
