  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections for installation,
      core capabilities, and examples. It provides specific use cases and code snippets
      for each module. However, it lacks edge case handling (e.g., error conditions,
      large file processing) and has an incomplete fragment processing section, which
      reduces completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This skill addresses real-world genomics tasks like overlap detection,
      coverage analysis, and ML preprocessing with practical code examples. It covers
      multiple genomic data types (BED, BigWig, fragments) and integrates with common
      workflows. The Rust/Python bindings offer performance benefits for computational
      genomics, making it highly actionable for researchers and developers.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A high-quality, practical skill for genomic interval analysis with strong
    performance focus, though it needs minor improvements in completeness and edge
    case coverage.
