  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, code
      examples, and specific constraints. It provides actionable guidance for common
      RL tasks and includes important notes about API usage. However, it references
      external files (scripts, references) that may not exist in the actual skill
      context, which could cause confusion if those resources aren't available.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for RL practitioners, covering core workflows
      like training, custom environments, and vectorization with concrete examples.
      It provides real value for prototyping and production RL experiments. The limitation
      is that it's more of a reference guide than a step-by-step tutorial, which might
      require users to have some prior RL knowledge to fully utilize it.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-crafted, production-ready RL skill prompt that provides comprehensive
    guidance for Stable Baselines3 usage, though its reliance on external reference
    files slightly diminishes its self-contained utility.
