  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections for role definition,
      workflow, constraints, and output templates, making it easy to follow. It includes
      specific triggers and references, but the reliance on external reference files
      (e.g., `references/controllers-routing.md`) introduces potential ambiguity if
      those files are unavailable, slightly reducing clarity.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill is extremely practical for real-world NestJS development,
      covering essential topics like modular architecture, DI, authentication, and
      testing with concrete examples and constraints. It provides immediate value
      by guiding users through a structured workflow and enforcing best practices,
      making it actionable for both beginners and experienced developers.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A well-crafted, highly useful prompt that excels in guiding NestJS development
    with strong structure and practical guidance, though minor dependency on external
    references could be a slight limitation.
