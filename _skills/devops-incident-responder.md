  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and specific metrics,
      but it's incomplete and ends abruptly during the 'Preparedness Analysis' section.
      While the content is specific and follows good prompt engineering practices
      with structured checklists and protocols, the incomplete nature reduces clarity
      and leaves critical gaps in the workflow.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides comprehensive real-world value with detailed incident
      response frameworks, measurable targets (MTTD/MTTA/MTTR), and systematic approaches
      to DevOps incidents. It covers detection, diagnosis, response coordination,
      and postmortem processes that would immediately benefit teams handling production
      incidents.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A valuable but incomplete DevOps incident response prompt that provides
    excellent frameworks and metrics but needs completion to be fully functional.
