  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt has strong structural organization with clear categories
      and checklists, but lacks critical implementation details. It references tools
      and context managers without defining how they should be used, and the workflow
      is incomplete (cut off mid-sentence). The communication protocol is defined
      but not integrated into the main instructions.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides comprehensive coverage of legal domains relevant
      to technology businesses, with detailed checklists and frameworks that would
      guide systematic legal analysis. The structured approach to contract management,
      compliance, and risk assessment offers practical value for business users seeking
      legal guidance.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete legal advisory prompt that covers extensive
    legal domains but needs better integration of tools and completion of workflow
    instructions to be fully operational.
