  description: Comprehensive healthcare AI toolkit for developing, testing, and deploying
  machine learning models with clinical data. This skill should be used when working
  with electronic health records (EHR), clinical prediction tasks (mortality, readmission,
  drug recommendation), medical coding systems (ICD, NDC, ATC), physiological signals
  (EEG, ECG), healthcare datasets (MIMIC-III/IV, eICU, OMOP), or implementing deep
  learning models for healthcare applications (RETAIN, Saf...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, specific
      examples, and a logical workflow. It defines scope comprehensively with concrete
      datasets, models, and tasks. The only minor limitation is that the documentation
      section is incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence, which slightly impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate practical value for healthcare AI development
      with a complete end-to-end workflow example covering data loading, task definition,
      model training, and evaluation. It addresses real-world clinical prediction
      tasks and includes performance metrics (3x faster than pandas), making it highly
      actionable for practitioners working with EHR data.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready healthcare AI skill prompt with comprehensive
    scope, clear workflow, and strong practical utility for clinical machine learning
    tasks.
