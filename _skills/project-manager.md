  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and comprehensive
      checklists covering all major project management domains. However, it's incomplete
      (cuts off mid-sentence in Implementation Phase) and lacks specific instructions
      for tool usage or how to handle the incomplete context query protocol. The structured
      format with JSON examples is good, but the abrupt ending reduces clarity.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides extensive project management frameworks, methodologies,
      and practical checklists that would be highly valuable for real project management
      tasks. It covers planning, execution, risk management, and closure comprehensively.
      The main limitation is the incomplete implementation phase, which reduces immediate
      actionability.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A comprehensive project management prompt with excellent structure and
    practical frameworks, but incomplete execution instructions limit its immediate
    usability.
