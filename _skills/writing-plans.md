  # Writing Plans


  ## Overview


  Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context
  for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know:
  which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check,
  how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent
  commits.
