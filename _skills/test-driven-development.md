  # Test-Driven Development (TDD)


  ## Overview


  Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.


  **Core principle:** If you didn''t watch the test fail, you don''t know if it tests
  the right thing.


  **Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**


  ## When to Use


  **Always:**

  - New features

  - Bug fixes

  - Refactoring

  - Behavior...'
