  # Test-Driven Development (TDD)


  ## Overview


  Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.


  **Core principle:** If you didn''t watch the test fail, you don''t know if it tests
  the right thing.


  **Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**


  ## When to Use


  **Always:**

  - New features

  - Bug fixes

  - Refactoring

  - Behavior...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and specific, with strong visual
      aids (dot diagram), concrete code examples, and explicit rules. It handles edge
      cases through exceptions and provides fallback guidance. The only minor issue
      is the incomplete 'REFACTOR' section at the end, which slightly reduces completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is a highly practical, real-world skill that directly addresses
      a common development challenge. It provides immediate, actionable guidance with
      clear steps, examples, and verification checkpoints. The comprehensive coverage
      of TDD principles makes it immediately beneficial for developers.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, comprehensive TDD prompt that provides clear, actionable
    guidance with strong visual and code examples, though slightly incomplete in the
    refactor section.
