  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear role definition,
      specific constraints, and actionable workflows. It follows best practices by
      defining triggers, scope, and output format upfront. The only minor limitation
      is the reference guide references external files that may not exist in all contexts,
      which could cause confusion if those resources aren't available.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate practical value for developers implementing
      security features, with comprehensive coverage of authentication, input validation,
      and OWASP prevention. The concrete constraints (e.g., 'hash passwords with bcrypt/argon2')
      and output templates make it highly actionable for real-world development tasks.
      It addresses critical security concerns that developers frequently encounter.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent security-focused prompt that balances comprehensive guidance
    with practical constraints, making it highly valuable for secure code development.
