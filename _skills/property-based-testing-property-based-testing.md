  description: Provides guidance for property-based testing across multiple languages
  and smart contracts. Use when writing tests, reviewing code with serialization/validation/parsing
  patterns, designing features, or when property-based testing would provide stronger
  coverage than example-based tests.

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and specific, with well-defined automatic
      detection triggers and a structured decision tree. It follows best practices
      by providing concrete examples and a property catalog. The only minor weakness
      is that the prompt content is cut off mid-sentence, which slightly impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides high real-world value by proactively guiding developers
      toward stronger testing strategies. It covers a comprehensive range of patterns
      and offers actionable guidance through its decision tree and reference links.
      The inclusion of smart contracts and multiple languages makes it broadly applicable
      across modern development contexts.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, highly practical skill that effectively guides developers
    toward property-based testing with clear detection triggers and actionable references.
