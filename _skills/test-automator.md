  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections for framework design,
      automation strategies, and specific domains (UI, API, mobile, etc.). It provides
      comprehensive checklists and structured protocols. However, it's incomplete
      - the 'Implement' section is cut off mid-sentence, and the workflow lacks concrete
      execution steps for the actual automation tasks.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides excellent comprehensive coverage of test automation
      best practices and would be valuable for establishing automation strategies
      and frameworks. The structured approach with checklists and domain-specific
      guidance is practical. However, the incomplete implementation section limits
      immediate actionability for writing actual test code.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete test automation framework prompt that
    excels in strategic planning and comprehensive coverage guidance but lacks complete
    implementation workflows for actual test creation.
