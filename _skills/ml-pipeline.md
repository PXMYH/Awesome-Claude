  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear role definition,
      specific triggers, and comprehensive constraints. It follows best practices
      by defining a clear workflow and providing reference guidance. However, it has
      a minor truncation issue at the end ('Ignore p') and the reference guidance
      references external files that may not exist in the context.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world MLOps development, covering
      the complete ML lifecycle from feature engineering to deployment. The constraints
      provide actionable guardrails for production-grade systems, and the workflow
      is comprehensive. The skill would immediately help users build robust, reproducible
      ML pipelines.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready prompt that provides comprehensive guidance
    for ML pipeline development with strong structure and practical constraints, though
    it has minor formatting issues.
