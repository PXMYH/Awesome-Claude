  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear categories and checklists,
      demonstrating strong organization. However, it contains significant incompleteness
      (e.g., 'Implementation app' is cut off) and lacks specific instructions for
      the agent's actual execution flow, making it ambiguous how to proceed after
      the initial context query. The communication protocol is defined but not integrated
      into the workflow, creating a disconnect.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides comprehensive MLOps coverage with detailed checklists
      and architectural considerations that are valuable for real-world ML platform
      design. It offers practical frameworks for infrastructure, CI/CD, and monitoring
      that would help users systematically address MLOps challenges. The structured
      approach enables actionable planning and gap analysis for ML teams.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-organized but incomplete MLOps prompt with strong conceptual coverage
    that lacks execution instructions, making it more suitable as a reference framework
    than a directly executable agent.
