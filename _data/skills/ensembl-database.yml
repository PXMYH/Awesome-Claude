  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and practical examples,
      but it's incomplete - the 'Genomic Region Analysis' section cuts off mid-sentence,
      leaving a gap in coverage. The examples are specific and actionable, showing
      both package-based and direct REST API approaches, which is helpful for different
      user preferences. However, it lacks explicit error handling guidance and edge
      case considerations for API failures or invalid inputs.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This skill provides high practical value for genomic researchers and
      bioinformaticians working with Ensembl data, covering essential operations like
      gene lookups, sequence retrieval, variant analysis, and comparative genomics.
      The inclusion of both Python package and direct REST API examples makes it immediately
      actionable for different technical backgrounds. The comprehensive scope across
      250+ species and current release version (115) shows relevance to real-world
      research pipelines.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A highly useful and well-structured scientific skill for Ensembl database
    queries, though incomplete in its current form, that effectively bridges the gap
    between API documentation and practical implementation for genomic research tasks.
