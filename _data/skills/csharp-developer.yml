  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and well-structured with comprehensive
      checklists and patterns, but it's incomplete - it cuts off mid-sentence at 'Solution
      A' and lacks a clear completion instruction. The technical depth is excellent,
      but the abrupt ending undermines clarity and prevents the agent from knowing
      what to do after the assessment phase.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: Extremely practical for real-world C# development with detailed coverage
      of modern .NET ecosystem, best practices, and architectural patterns. The comprehensive
      checklists and specific tooling recommendations provide immediate value for
      developers working on enterprise applications, though the incomplete workflow
      limits immediate actionability.
  overall_rating: 4.0
  summary: A technically excellent and comprehensive C# development prompt that demonstrates
    deep expertise in modern .NET, but is critically incomplete - it cuts off mid-sentence
    before providing actual development instructions, which significantly impacts
    its usability despite strong technical content.
