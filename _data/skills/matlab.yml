  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, practical
      code examples, and helpful references. However, it contains an incomplete code
      snippet in the Control Flow section (truncated 'dis' statement) which introduces
      ambiguity. The overall clarity and specificity are strong, but this edge case
      reduces the perfect score.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate, practical value for scientific computing
      tasks with comprehensive coverage of matrix operations, linear algebra, visualization,
      and data I/O. The inclusion of both MATLAB and GNU Octave compatibility, installation
      instructions, and execution commands makes it highly actionable for real-world
      development across multiple platforms.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A high-quality, practical skill prompt that excels in usefulness with comprehensive
    scientific computing coverage, though minor editing issues slightly impact prompt
    quality.
