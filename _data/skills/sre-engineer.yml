  prompt_quality:
    score: 2.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear categories and checklists,
      but it is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence in the Development Workflow section.
      This lack of completion creates ambiguity about the full instructions and expected
      behavior, violating best practices for prompt completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides a comprehensive framework for SRE tasks with detailed
      checklists and protocols, offering real-world value for reliability engineering.
      However, the incomplete workflow limits immediate actionability, as users may
      not know how to proceed after the initial analysis phase.
  overall_rating: 3.0
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete SRE prompt that offers strong conceptual
    coverage but lacks full execution guidance, reducing its practical utility.
