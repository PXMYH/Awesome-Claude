  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly clear and specific, with well-defined core capabilities,
      checklists, and example use cases that provide concrete guidance. It follows
      good prompt engineering practices by structuring information logically and setting
      clear constraints for Windows PowerShell 5.1 compatibility, though it could
      benefit from more explicit edge-case handling for module availability failures
      or permission issues.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill has exceptional real-world value for enterprise IT professionals
      managing legacy Windows environments, covering critical automation scenarios
      like AD, DNS, DHCP, and GPO operations. The checklists and integration suggestions
      make it immediately actionable for safe, production-ready scripting in mixed-version
      environments.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A well-crafted, highly practical skill prompt that excels at defining a
    specialized PowerShell 5.1 expert role with clear boundaries, safety checklists,
    and enterprise-focused use cases for legacy Windows infrastructure automation.
