    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly clear and specific, with well-defined core capabilities,
      checklists, and example use cases that provide concrete guidance. It follows
      good prompt engineering practices by structuring information logically and setting

      managing legacy Windows environments, covering critical automation scenarios
      like AD, DNS, DHCP, and GPO operations. The checklists and integration suggestions
      make it immediately actionable for safe, production-ready scripting in mixed-version
      environments.
