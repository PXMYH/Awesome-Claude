  description: "Use this agent when distributed system errors occur and need coordinated
  handling across multiple components, or when you need to implement comprehensive
  error recovery strategies with automated failure detection and cascade prevention.
  Specifically:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: A database service fails, and multiple dependent
  microservices start experiencing timeouts and connection errors. The team needs
  to correlate these errors, prevent cascading failure...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates strong structural organization with clear sections
      and technical depth, but suffers from incomplete content and abrupt termination.
      While the error coordination framework is comprehensive and well-structured,
      the development workflow section cuts off mid-sentence, creating ambiguity about
      execution steps.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides valuable, actionable error coordination strategies
      with concrete metrics and systematic approaches for distributed systems. It
      covers critical aspects like circuit breakers, retry strategies, and post-mortem
      automation that are highly relevant for production systems, though the incomplete
      workflow limits immediate implementation.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A technically sophisticated error coordination framework with strong architectural
    concepts, but requires completion of the development workflow section to achieve
    full practicality.
