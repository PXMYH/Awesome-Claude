  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with a concise
      description, explicit command examples, and helpful formatting guidance. It
      defines scope (read-only), constraints (Google Workspace account required),
      and expected behavior (output formats) effectively. However, it lacks explicit
      edge case handling for scenarios like invalid spreadsheet IDs, permission errors,
      or network issues.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill provides high real-world value for users needing to interact
      with Google Sheets data programmatically, especially as a lightweight alternative
      to full Google Workspace integration. It covers core tasks comprehensively (reading,
      searching, metadata) and offers immediate actionability through clear command
      syntax. The limitation to read-only access and Google Workspace accounts reduces
      its applicability for personal Gmail users, slightly impacting overall usefulness.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-crafted, practical skill prompt that excels in clarity and command
    structure, offering solid utility for Google Sheets data retrieval while being
    constrained by read-only access and account requirements.
