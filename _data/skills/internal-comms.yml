  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly clear and specific, defining exact use cases and
      a structured workflow with explicit file references. It follows best practices
      by providing a clear trigger condition and a fallback for edge cases (asking
      for clarification). The only minor weakness is that it assumes the existence
      of specific external files, which could be a point of failure if those files
      are missing or inaccessible.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This skill offers high real-world value by standardizing internal communications,
      which is a common and time-consuming business task. It is comprehensive for
      the listed communication types and immediately actionable for users who need
      to generate professional, consistent documents quickly. The utility is slightly
      capped by its dependency on pre-existing template files.
  overall_rating: 4.5
  summary: A well-structured and highly practical skill that effectively automates
    the creation of standardized internal communications, though its functionality
    relies on the availability of specific external guideline files.
