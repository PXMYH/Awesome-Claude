  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and comprehensive, covering extensive
      Rust concepts from ownership to async programming with clear technical depth.
      However, it contains an incomplete JSON structure in the 'Communication Protocol'
      section that appears truncated, which reduces clarity and creates ambiguity
      about the intended interaction pattern.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This prompt provides exceptional real-world value for Rust development,
      covering modern best practices, tooling, and comprehensive checklists that mirror
      professional development workflows. The structured approach to ownership, traits,
      error handling, and performance optimization makes it immediately actionable
      for complex systems programming tasks.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A technically excellent Rust engineering prompt with comprehensive coverage
    of advanced concepts and professional workflows, though slightly marred by an
    incomplete JSON structure in the communication protocol section.
