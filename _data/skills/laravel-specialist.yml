  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections and specific technical
      requirements, following good prompt engineering practices. It provides comprehensive
      checklists and patterns, though the 'Communication Protocol' section introduces
      a context manager query that may not be standard in all agent systems.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt offers substantial real-world value for Laravel development
      with extensive coverage of modern features, patterns, and enterprise considerations.
      It's actionable for developers but assumes specific tool availability and may
      be overwhelming for beginners due to its comprehensive scope.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured, comprehensive Laravel specialist prompt that excels
    in technical depth and organization, though it may benefit from simplification
    for broader accessibility and clearer tool integration.
