  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections, specific examples,
      and actionable instructions. It follows good prompt engineering practices with
      defined scope, allowed tools, and metadata. However, it's incomplete (cuts off
      mid-sentence in the ACM section) and the 'scientific-schematics' skill reference
      appears to be a hallucinated tool that doesn't exist in the allowed-tools list.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill addresses a genuine need for researchers preparing manuscripts
      with venue-specific formatting requirements. It provides concrete examples of
      journals, conferences, and grant agencies. The inclusion of LaTeX templates
      and submission guidelines would be valuable for academic workflows, though the
      incomplete content and questionable tool references reduce practical reliability.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete skill prompt that addresses a real academic
    need for venue-specific formatting, though it contains hallucinated tool references
    and cuts off mid-document.
