  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: 'The prompt provides clear, well-structured examples for core COBRApy
      functionality, but has a critical flaw: it''s incomplete, ending abruptly mid-sentence
      in the ''Manual knockout using context manager'' section. While the existing
      content is specific and follows good practices, the incomplete nature undermines
      reliability and creates ambiguity about the skill''s full capabilities.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: Despite the incomplete ending, the prompt covers essential COBRApy
      workflows for metabolic modeling including model loading, FBA, FVA, and gene
      knockouts, which are highly valuable for systems biology research. The practical
      examples enable immediate implementation for common metabolic engineering tasks.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A useful but incomplete COBRApy prompt with solid core content that needs
    completion to be fully reliable for scientific applications.
