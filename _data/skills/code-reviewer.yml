  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear categories and checklists,
      but it's overly verbose and contains incomplete sections (e.g., 'Context evaluation'
      ends abruptly). While specific in its review criteria, it lacks clear instructions
      on how to execute the review workflow or handle edge cases like missing code
      context.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The comprehensive checklist covering security, performance, design
      patterns, and technical debt provides strong real-world value for code quality
      assurance. However, the utility is limited by the incomplete workflow instructions
      and lack of integration guidance for actual development environments.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-intentioned but incomplete code review prompt with excellent coverage
    of review criteria, though it needs better workflow execution guidance and completion
    of incomplete sections.
