  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear hierarchical
      organization (Overview, When to Use, Installation, Core Concepts, Quick Start).
      It provides specific code examples and explains the three main classes of featurizers
      with their appropriate use cases. However, it lacks explicit handling of edge
      cases (e.g., invalid SMILES, memory constraints) and doesn't include error handling
      examples.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is a highly practical and valuable skill for cheminformatics and
      molecular ML practitioners. It covers 100+ featurizers, provides concrete installation
      instructions with optional dependencies, and demonstrates real-world workflows
      for QSAR, virtual screening, and deep learning. The scikit-learn compatibility
      and parallel processing features make it immediately actionable for production
      pipelines.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready skill prompt that comprehensively covers
    molecular featurization with clear structure, practical examples, and strong real-world
    applicability for cheminformatics and ML workflows.
