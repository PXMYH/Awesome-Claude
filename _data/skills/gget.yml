  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides clear structure with categories and examples, but
      has significant gaps in completeness. The 'gget info' section is incomplete
      (cut off mid-example), and some modules are mentioned in the overview without
      detailed documentation. The installation instructions are specific but may be
      confusing for users unfamiliar with 'uv'.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: High practical value for bioinformatics workflows, covering 20+ databases
      with consistent CLI/Python interfaces. The quick start and module categories
      help users quickly find relevant tools for gene info, BLAST, structures, and
      enrichment analysis. The distinction between gget and alternatives like biopython/bioservices
      is helpful for decision-making.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete bioinformatics skill prompt with strong
    practical utility, though documentation gaps and some unclear installation guidance
    reduce its effectiveness.
