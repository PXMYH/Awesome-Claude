  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections for
      overview, installation, quick start, and core workflows. It provides specific
      code examples for common use cases and handles edge cases like problematic files.
      However, the prompt is incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence in the metadata section),
      which prevents a perfect score.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for scientific computing, providing immediate
      value for flow cytometry data processing. It covers essential workflows like
      reading FCS files, extracting metadata, handling edge cases, and creating new
      files. The inclusion of memory-efficient reading and error handling makes it
      production-ready for real-world applications.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A comprehensive and well-designed skill prompt for flow cytometry file
    handling that provides clear, actionable guidance for scientific data processing,
    though it appears to be truncated in the final section.
