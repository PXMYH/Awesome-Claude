  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates strong structural organization with clear categories
      and checklists, but lacks completeness as it cuts off mid-sentence during the
      'Task eva' section. While the framework is comprehensive and follows good prompt
      engineering practices with defined protocols and structured data, the abrupt
      ending creates ambiguity about the full workflow and expected outputs.
  usefulness:
    score: 3.0
    reasoning: The skill provides valuable frameworks for multi-agent orchestration
      with practical checklists and criteria that could help organize complex workflows.
      However, the incomplete nature limits immediate actionability, and the abstract
      concepts need more concrete implementation guidance to be truly useful for real
      development tasks.
  overall_rating: 3.25
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete meta-orchestration skill that provides
    excellent frameworks for agent organization, though the truncated content prevents
    full evaluation of its practical implementation value.
