  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections for role definition,
      workflow, constraints, and references, making it easy to follow. It uses specific
      triggers and output templates, adhering to prompt engineering best practices.
      However, the reference guide references external files that may not be accessible,
      which could limit clarity in some contexts.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill is extremely practical for real-world React Native development,
      covering essential topics like navigation, performance optimization, and platform-specific
      handling. It provides actionable constraints and workflows that directly address
      common pain points in mobile app development. The inclusion of modern tools
      like Expo SDK 50+ and React Navigation 7 ensures relevance for current projects.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A well-crafted, highly useful prompt that excels in specificity and practicality
    for React Native developers, with minor limitations in reference accessibility.
