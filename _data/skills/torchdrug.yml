  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, specific
      installation instructions, and practical code examples. It defines scope through
      explicit 'When to Use' criteria and provides concrete use cases. The only minor
      limitation is that some reference sections are truncated, which could be more
      complete.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides immediate practical value with working code examples,
      installation commands, and clear guidance on when to use TorchDrug versus alternatives
      like DeepChem. It covers real-world drug discovery tasks comprehensively and
      enables users to start development immediately.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready prompt that balances technical depth with
    accessibility, providing clear guidance for both beginners and experienced practitioners
    in drug discovery ML.
