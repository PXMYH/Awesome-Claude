  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections for different use
      cases (reading/analysis vs. creation) and provides specific technical instructions.
      However, it appears truncated at the end (cut off mid-sentence in the color
      palette section), which reduces clarity and completeness. The instructions for
      XML access and tool usage are specific and actionable.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill provides practical workflows for common PowerPoint tasks
      like text extraction, XML analysis, and HTML-to-PPTX conversion. The inclusion
      of specific file paths and command examples makes it immediately actionable
      for developers. However, the truncated content and lack of complete guidance
      on the HTML-to-PPTX workflow limits its full practical value.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A technically sound prompt with clear workflows for PowerPoint manipulation,
    but the truncated content and incomplete sections prevent it from reaching its
    full potential as a comprehensive skill.
