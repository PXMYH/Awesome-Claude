  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear diagrams and a well-defined
      two-stage review process. However, it references external files (./implementer-prompt.md,
      etc.) without providing their content, creating ambiguity. The core principle
      is clearly stated, but the incomplete diagram and missing sub-prompt details
      reduce clarity.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This is a practical, high-value pattern for complex development tasks,
      promoting quality and speed through parallel subagent workflows. The two-stage
      review (spec then code quality) addresses common development pitfalls. It would
      be immediately actionable for users with implementation plans, though it requires
      the referenced sub-prompt files to be fully functional.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured, high-quality prompt for parallel task execution with
    built-in quality gates, but its practicality depends on the completeness of the
    referenced sub-prompt files.
