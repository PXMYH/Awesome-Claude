  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly clear and specific, defining exact GitHub API
      endpoints, directory paths, and workflow steps. It includes practical examples
      and covers core operations like listing, searching, and installing agents. However,
      it lacks explicit handling for edge cases like network failures, invalid agent
      names, or permission issues during installation.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate practical value for developers wanting
      to extend Claude Code with community agents, covering the full lifecycle from
      discovery to installation. It addresses a real need for ecosystem expansion
      and follows actionable workflows that users can immediately apply to enhance
      their development environment.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A well-structured, highly practical prompt that effectively enables users
    to browse and install community Claude agents, with strong clarity and real-world
    utility for ecosystem management.
