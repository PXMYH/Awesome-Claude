  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear workflows and decision trees,
      making it easy to follow. It provides specific commands and file references,
      though it lacks explicit error handling guidance for edge cases like corrupted
      files or permission issues.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This skill covers a comprehensive range of document operations from
      creation to analysis, addressing real-world professional needs. The workflows
      are practical and actionable, though the dependency on external files (docx-js.md,
      ooxml.md) creates a potential point of failure if those resources are unavailable.
  overall_rating: 4.5
  summary: A well-structured, practical skill for document manipulation that balances
    high-level workflows with technical implementation details, though it could benefit
    from more robust error handling and dependency management guidance.
