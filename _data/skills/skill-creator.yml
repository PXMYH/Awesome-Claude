  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with a logical
      flow from core principles to practical anatomy. It provides specific guidance
      on context window management and appropriate degrees of freedom, though it's
      incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence in the references section). The YAML frontmatter
      requirements are clearly defined.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill provides high practical value for users creating custom
      skills, offering concrete frameworks for decision-making and structure. It's
      actionable and addresses real development challenges like token efficiency and
      context management. However, its incomplete state limits immediate utility,
      and it assumes familiarity with the skill ecosystem.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-crafted, principled guide for skill creation that balances conciseness
    with practical guidance, though its incomplete presentation prevents full evaluation
    of its comprehensive value.
