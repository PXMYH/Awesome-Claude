  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections for
      when to use, when not to use, and rationalizations to reject. The workflow is
      detailed and actionable, though the output format section is incomplete (cut
      off mid-sentence in the JSON table). The allowed-tools and disable-model-invocation
      settings are appropriately configured for a security scanning tool.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill addresses a critical real-world security need for Firebase-backed
      Android applications. It provides comprehensive coverage of Firebase vulnerabilities
      including databases, storage, authentication, and cloud functions. The inclusion
      of ethical guidelines and rejection of common rationalizations makes it practical
      for professional security assessments.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A highly effective security scanning skill with excellent prompt structure,
    comprehensive coverage of Firebase vulnerabilities, and strong ethical guidelines
    for authorized testing.
