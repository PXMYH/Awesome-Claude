  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, tables,
      and examples. It defines precise constraints (read-only, row limits, query types)
      and includes comprehensive safety features. The only minor weakness is the lack
      of explicit error handling examples for common edge cases like connection failures
      or malformed queries.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill addresses a critical real-world need for safe database exploration
      and analysis. The multi-database support with intelligent auto-selection based
      on descriptions makes it highly practical for teams managing multiple environments.
      The comprehensive safety features and clear workflow make it immediately actionable
      for developers, analysts, and operations teams.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready skill that balances powerful functionality
    with robust safety measures, making it suitable for both development and production
    environments.
