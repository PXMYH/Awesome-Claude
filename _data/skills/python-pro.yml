  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and specific, defining a precise
      persona and comprehensive checklist for Python development. It follows best
      practices by structuring knowledge into distinct domains (type safety, async,
      data science, etc.). However, it lacks explicit edge case handling (e.g., legacy
      Python versions) and the final 'Security best practices' section is cut off,
      slightly reducing completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt is highly practical and valuable for real-world Python
      development, covering modern best practices (3.11+, async, type safety) and
      a wide range of domains (web, data science, automation). It provides actionable
      checklists and patterns that directly improve code quality, making it immediately
      beneficial for developers aiming for production-ready solutions.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A robust, expert-level prompt that excels in specificity and practical
    utility, though minor formatting issues slightly impact its polish.
