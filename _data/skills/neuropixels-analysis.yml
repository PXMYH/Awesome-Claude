  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, comprehensive
      tables for hardware/formats, and practical code examples. It follows excellent
      prompt engineering practices with specific trigger conditions and a complete
      workflow. The only minor issue is an incomplete code snippet in the spike sorting
      section that cuts off mid-example.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is an extremely practical and valuable skill for neuroscientists
      working with Neuropixels data. It covers the entire analysis pipeline from raw
      data to curated results, includes real-world file formats and tools, and provides
      both high-level wrappers and detailed step-by-step workflows. The inclusion
      of quality metrics, curation criteria, and visualization makes it production-ready.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding scientific skill that provides comprehensive, production-ready
    Neuropixels analysis capabilities with excellent structure, practical examples,
    and coverage of the full workflow from data loading to publication-ready results.
