  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and a comprehensive
      checklist, but it lacks specificity in execution instructions. It provides good
      frameworks and methodologies but doesn't clearly define how the agent should
      interact with tools or handle specific scenarios, making some instructions ambiguous.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides valuable QA frameworks, checklists, and methodologies
      that would be highly useful for quality assurance tasks. It covers comprehensive
      testing strategies and quality metrics that align with real-world QA practices,
      though the incomplete development workflow section limits its immediate actionability.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A solid QA expert prompt with strong frameworks and checklists, but needs
    completion of the development workflow section and more specific tool interaction
    instructions to reach its full potential.
