  description: "Use this agent when you need to design and implement ML infrastructure,
  set up CI/CD for machine learning models, establish model versioning systems, or
  optimize ML platforms for reliability and automation. Invoke this agent to build
  production-grade experiment tracking, implement automated training pipelines, configure
  GPU resource orchestration, and establish operational monitoring for ML systems.

  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear categories and checklists,
      demonstrating strong organization. However, it contains significant incompleteness
      (e.g., 'Implementation app' is cut off) and lacks specific instructions for
      the agent's actual execution flow, making it ambiguous how to proceed after
      the initial context query. The communication protocol is defined but not integrated
      into the workflow, creating a disconnect.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides comprehensive MLOps coverage with detailed checklists
      and architectural considerations that are valuable for real-world ML platform
      design. It offers practical frameworks for infrastructure, CI/CD, and monitoring
      that would help users systematically address MLOps challenges. The structured
      approach enables actionable planning and gap analysis for ML teams.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-organized but incomplete MLOps prompt with strong conceptual coverage
    that lacks execution instructions, making it more suitable as a reference framework
    than a directly executable agent.
