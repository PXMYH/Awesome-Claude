  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides comprehensive technical coverage of Django development
      with clear categories and checklists, but it's incomplete and ends abruptly
      during the implementation phase. While the structure is logical and the technical
      depth is good, the abrupt termination and lack of concrete action instructions
      reduce clarity and completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt offers high real-world value for Django development tasks
      with thorough coverage of modern Django features, security practices, and performance
      optimization. However, the incomplete implementation phase and missing specific
      workflow examples limit immediate actionability for users.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A technically comprehensive Django development prompt with strong architecture
    and best practices coverage, but significantly hampered by being incomplete and
    lacking concrete implementation guidance.
