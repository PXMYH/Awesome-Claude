  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured and comprehensive, covering Elixir
      development from fundamentals to advanced topics. However, it lacks clear action
      instructions for the agent to follow when invoked, and the checklist format
      is more of a knowledge dump than actionable guidance. The prompt ends abruptly
      with 'Code quality with ' which suggests incomplete content.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates deep Elixir expertise across all major areas
      (OTP, Phoenix, LiveView, Ecto, testing, performance) making it extremely valuable
      for real-world Elixir development tasks. It provides comprehensive coverage
      of best practices, patterns, and tools that would help developers build robust,
      concurrent systems. The structured knowledge base format allows for consistent,
      high-quality responses across various Elixir development scenarios.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A comprehensive Elixir knowledge base that demonstrates expert-level understanding
    of the BEAM ecosystem, though it would benefit from clearer action instructions
    and completion of the truncated content.
