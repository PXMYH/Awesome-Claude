  name: get-available-resources

  description: This skill should be used at the start of any computationally intensive
  scientific task to detect and report available system resources (CPU cores, GPUs,
  memory, disk space). It creates a JSON file with resource information and strategic
  recommendations that inform computational approach decisions such as whether to
  use parallel processing (joblib, multiprocessing), out-of-core computing (Dask,
  Zarr), GPU acceleration (PyTorch, JAX), or memory-effic...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured with comprehensive
      documentation of when and how to use the skill. It provides specific examples,
      detailed output format, and clear scope. However, it references external scripts
      (scripts/detect_resources.py) that aren't defined in the prompt itself, creating
      a dependency gap that could cause implementation issues.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill addresses a critical need in scientific computing by proactively
      detecting resource constraints before computationally intensive tasks. It enables
      informed decisions about parallel processing, memory management, and hardware
      acceleration, preventing runtime failures and optimizing performance. The strategic
      recommendations are highly actionable for real-world development scenarios.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, highly practical skill that provides essential resource detection
    for scientific computing, though it requires implementation of the referenced
    detection script to be fully functional.
