  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates strong domain knowledge with comprehensive
      technical checklists covering Kubernetes best practices, architecture, and operational
      considerations. However, it lacks clarity in execution flow - the communication
      protocol and development workflow sections are incomplete and don't provide
      clear action steps for the AI to follow when invoked.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides substantial real-world value by outlining enterprise-grade
      Kubernetes requirements and best practices that would guide production deployments.
      The comprehensive checklists and domain coverage make it highly actionable for
      infrastructure planning and cluster management tasks, though the incomplete
      workflow sections limit immediate usability.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A technically comprehensive Kubernetes specialist prompt with strong domain
    knowledge and enterprise focus, but hampered by incomplete workflow instructions
    that reduce clarity of execution.
