  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, specific
      examples, and practical guidance. It follows prompt engineering best practices
      by defining scope, constraints, and expected behavior. The only minor limitation
      is that the prompt is truncated mid-sentence in the Bags section, which slightly
      impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides high practical value for real-world scientific
      computing tasks, covering the most common Dask use cases with actionable examples.
      It comprehensively addresses scaling pandas/NumPy workflows, parallel processing,
      and distributed computing scenarios that developers frequently encounter.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready prompt that effectively guides users on
    when and how to use Dask for distributed computing, with strong practical applicability
    for scientific and data engineering workflows.
