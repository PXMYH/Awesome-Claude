  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured with a logical
      workflow (discovery → execution). It provides specific, copy-pasteable commands
      with diverse examples covering filesystem, memory, and GitHub servers. The inclusion
      of prerequisites and installation instructions is comprehensive, though it lacks
      explicit error handling guidance for when the CLI fails or servers are unavailable.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: 'This skill addresses a critical need in the MCP ecosystem: avoiding
      context pollution while exploring server capabilities. It enables practical
      one-off tasks like testing servers, debugging, or making temporary integrations
      without permanent configuration. The workflow is immediately actionable for
      developers working with multiple MCP servers, saving significant setup time
      and reducing context window bloat.'
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready skill that provides a clean solution to
    MCP server management, with strong practical value for developers needing flexible,
    on-demand server access.
