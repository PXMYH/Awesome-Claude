  prompt_quality:
    score: 2.5
    reasoning: The prompt has structural issues with incomplete sections (the Implementation
      Phase is cut off mid-sentence) and inconsistent version references (Rails 8.1
      in description vs Rails 7.x in checklist). While it provides comprehensive checklists
      and patterns, the abrupt truncation and mixed versioning create ambiguity about
      the intended scope and completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: Despite quality issues, the prompt contains valuable Rails-specific
      guidance including modern features like Hotwire/Turbo, Action Cable, and comprehensive
      testing strategies. The structured checklists and workflow phases would help
      developers follow Rails conventions, though the incomplete implementation section
      limits immediate actionability.
  overall_rating: 3.0
  summary: A comprehensive Rails development prompt with strong architectural guidance
    and modern feature coverage, but significantly hampered by incomplete content
    and version inconsistencies that reduce reliability.
