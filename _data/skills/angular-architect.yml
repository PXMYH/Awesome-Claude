  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections for
      architecture, RxJS, state management, and enterprise patterns. It follows best
      practices by defining a specific role, tools, and a systematic workflow. However,
      it lacks explicit instructions for handling edge cases like missing project
      context or conflicting requirements, and the workflow is incomplete (cuts off
      mid-sentence).
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides high real-world value for enterprise Angular development,
      covering comprehensive topics from architecture to micro-frontends and Nx monorepos.
      It's actionable for experienced developers but may be overwhelming for beginners.
      The checklist format is practical for ensuring quality, though the incomplete
      workflow reduces immediate usability.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A robust, expert-level Angular architect prompt with excellent structure
    and comprehensive coverage of enterprise patterns, though it suffers from an incomplete
    workflow section and could benefit from more explicit edge-case handling.
