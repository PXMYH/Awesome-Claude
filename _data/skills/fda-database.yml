  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with a logical
      flow from overview to quick start and detailed category breakdowns. It provides
      specific code examples and actionable setup instructions, though it lacks explicit
      error handling guidance for API failures or rate limits.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill offers high real-world value for FDA regulatory analysis,
      pharmacovigilance, and safety research across multiple domains. It covers comprehensive
      endpoints with practical examples, enabling immediate use for drug, device,
      food, and substance data queries.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A robust, well-documented skill that effectively bridges FDA's openFDA
    API with practical Python interfaces for scientific and regulatory analysis.
