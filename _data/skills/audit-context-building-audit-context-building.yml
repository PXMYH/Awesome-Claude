  # Deep Context Builder Skill (Ultra-Granular Pure Context Mode)


  ## 1. Purpose


  This skill governs **how Claude thinks** during the context-building phase of an
  audit.


  When active, Claude will:

  - Perform **line-by-line / block-by-block** code analysis by default.

  - Apply **First Principles**, **5 Whys**, and **5 Hows** at...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear phases, specific
      methodologies (First Principles, 5 Whys/Hows), and explicit rationalizations
      that prevent common AI pitfalls. It defines precise scope and behavior, though
      the incomplete section at the end slightly reduces clarity.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This provides significant real-world value for security auditing by
      enforcing systematic, bottom-up analysis that reduces hallucinations and context
      loss. It's highly actionable for developers and auditors, though the ultra-granular
      approach may be overly time-intensive for simpler codebases.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A sophisticated, well-engineered prompt that establishes rigorous context-building
    protocols for security analysis, though its incomplete final section and potentially
    excessive granularity for some use cases prevent a perfect score.
