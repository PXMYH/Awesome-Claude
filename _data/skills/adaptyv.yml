  description: Cloud laboratory platform for automated protein testing and validation.
  Use when designing proteins and needing experimental validation including binding
  assays, expression testing, thermostability measurements, enzyme activity assays,
  or protein sequence optimization. Also use for submitting experiments via API, tracking
  experiment status, downloading results, optimizing protein sequences for better
  expression using computational tools (NetSolP, SoluProt, SolubleM...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is clear and well-structured, providing specific instructions
      for authentication, installation, and basic usage with concrete code examples.
      It defines the scope well by listing available experiment types and optimization
      tools, though it lacks detailed edge case handling for API failures or authentication
      issues.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This skill offers high practical value for protein design workflows
      by connecting AI-driven design with wet-lab validation, covering key steps from
      sequence optimization to experimental submission. The inclusion of specific
      computational tools (NetSolP, SoluProt, etc.) and API integration makes it immediately
      actionable for researchers and developers.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-crafted skill prompt that effectively bridges computational protein
    design with experimental validation, offering clear guidance for integration into
    automated workflows.
