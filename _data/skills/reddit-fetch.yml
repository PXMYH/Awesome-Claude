  # Reddit Fetch via Gemini CLI


  When WebFetch fails to access Reddit (blocked, 403, etc.), use Gemini CLI via tmux.


  Pick a unique session name (e.g., `gemini_abc123`) and use it consistently throughout.


  ## Setup


  ```bash

  tmux new-session -d -s <session_name> -x 200 -y 50

  tmux...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and actionable, providing exact commands
      for tmux session management and Gemini CLI interaction. It includes a clear
      diagnostic method for determining if the Enter key was sent, which is a critical
      edge case for CLI automation. However, it lacks broader context about why WebFetch
      might be blocked and offers no alternative strategies if the Gemini CLI itself
      fails or is unavailable.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This skill provides a concrete, practical workaround for a common real-world
      problem where web fetching tools are blocked by sites like Reddit. The step-by-step
      instructions are immediately executable for users with the required environment
      (tmux, Gemini CLI). It directly addresses a specific pain point in research
      and data gathering workflows, offering high value for affected users.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A highly practical and specific skill that effectively solves a niche but
    frustrating access problem, though it assumes a specific toolchain and could benefit
    from more robust error handling.
