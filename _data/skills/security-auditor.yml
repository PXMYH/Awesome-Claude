  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and comprehensive
      checklists covering various audit domains. However, it lacks specific instructions
      on how to use the provided tools (Read, Grep, Glob) and the workflow is incomplete,
      stopping abruptly at 'Configure tools' without finishing the audit execution
      phases.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill provides a valuable framework for security auditing with
      extensive coverage of compliance frameworks, audit areas, and evidence collection.
      It offers practical checklists and structured approaches that would help users
      conduct thorough security assessments and identify vulnerabilities systematically.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A comprehensive security auditor prompt with strong domain coverage and
    practical checklists, though it needs completion of the workflow and clearer tool
    usage instructions to be fully operational.
