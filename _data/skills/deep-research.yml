  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and specific, providing precise CLI
      commands, setup instructions, and expected outcomes. It effectively defines
      the skill's scope, constraints (time/cost), and workflow, though it lacks explicit
      error handling guidance for API failures or network issues.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This skill offers high real-world value for autonomous research tasks
      like market analysis and technical reviews, with clear actionable steps. It's
      comprehensive for its niche, though the cost and time estimates may limit frequent
      use for casual users.
  overall_rating: 4.5
  summary: A well-structured, practical skill for automated research with clear instructions
    and realistic expectations, though it could benefit from more robust error handling
    documentation.
