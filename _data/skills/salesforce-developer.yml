  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear role definition,
      specific constraints, and comprehensive workflow guidance. It follows prompt
      engineering best practices with explicit 'MUST DO' and 'MUST NOT DO' sections,
      and provides actionable output templates. The only minor limitation is the reference
      guide section which references external files that may not exist in the actual
      implementation context.

    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides immediate, practical value for Salesforce development
      tasks with comprehensive coverage of Apex, LWC, SOQL, and integration patterns.
      The constraints and best practices directly address real-world challenges like
      governor limits and bulkification. The workflow and output templates make it
      immediately actionable for developers at any skill level.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding Salesforce developer prompt that balances technical depth
    with practical guidance, providing clear constraints and best practices that directly
