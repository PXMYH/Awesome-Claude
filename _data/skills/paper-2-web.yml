  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, specific
      trigger phrases, and defined capabilities. It follows best practices by including
      metadata, license info, and tool permissions. However, the content is incomplete
      (cut off mid-sentence in the Paper2Web section), which slightly impacts clarity
      and completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill addresses a real academic need for converting papers into
      multiple presentation formats, which is highly practical for researchers. It
      provides actionable trigger phrases and clear use cases. The inclusion of scientific
      schematics generation adds significant value, though the incomplete description
      limits full assessment of implementation details.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-designed academic transformation skill with strong structure and
    practical value, though the truncated content prevents full evaluation of its
    complete capabilities.
