  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: 'The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and comprehensive
      checklists covering various sales engineering activities. However, it has significant
      issues: the ''Communication Protocol'' section includes a JSON query that appears
      incomplete and doesn''t align with typical prompt engineering patterns, and
      the ''Development Workflow'' section is cut off mid-sentence. The prompt also
      mixes tool specifications with role definitions in a way that could confuse
      the AI about its actual capabilities.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides valuable structure for sales engineering tasks
      with detailed checklists covering demos, POCs, solution architecture, RFP responses,
      and technical objections. The comprehensive coverage of sales engineering activities
      makes it practical for real-world technical sales scenarios. However, the incomplete
      sections and unclear tool usage instructions reduce its immediate actionability.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A comprehensive but partially incomplete sales engineering prompt with
    strong structural organization and practical checklists, though it suffers from
    cut-off content and unclear tool integration that limits its immediate usability.
