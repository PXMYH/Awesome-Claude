  description: Python library for working with DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications
  in Medicine) files. Use this skill when reading, writing, or modifying medical imaging
  data in DICOM format, extracting pixel data from medical images (CT, MRI, X-ray,
  ultrasound), anonymizing DICOM files, working with DICOM metadata and tags, converting
  DICOM images to other formats, handling compressed DICOM data, or processing medical
  imaging datasets. Applies to tasks involving medical im...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: 'The prompt is generally clear and well-structured with good sections
      for installation, workflows, and examples. However, it has a significant issue:
      the ''Multi-frame images'' section is incomplete with a truncated comment ''#
      For mu''. This creates ambiguity and breaks the flow. The examples are practical
      and follow good coding practices, but the incomplete section reduces overall
      clarity.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The skill is highly practical for medical imaging tasks, covering essential
      operations like reading DICOM files, extracting pixel data, windowing for display,
      and handling color images. The inclusion of installation commands for common
      dependencies and compression libraries adds real-world value. The examples are
      actionable and relevant to actual development scenarios in healthcare imaging.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured and practical skill for working with DICOM medical imaging
    files, though it suffers from an incomplete section that needs correction to reach
    its full potential.
