  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and practical code
      examples. However, it lacks explicit instructions on how the AI should respond
      to user queries, edge case handling, and fallback guidance. The prompt is more
      of a reference guide than an active instruction set for the AI agent.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: High practical value for Solana developers working with Helius infrastructure.
      Covers core services comprehensively with real code examples. The inclusion
      of specific API methods and use cases makes it immediately actionable for developers
      setting up RPC, querying NFTs, or optimizing transactions.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A solid reference guide for Helius Solana infrastructure that provides
    high practical value but needs more explicit AI agent instructions to reach its
    full potential as a skill.
