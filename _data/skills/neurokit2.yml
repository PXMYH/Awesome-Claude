  description: Comprehensive biosignal processing toolkit for analyzing physiological
  data including ECG, EEG, EDA, RSP, PPG, EMG, and EOG signals. Use this skill when
  processing cardiovascular signals, brain activity, electrodermal responses, respiratory
  patterns, muscle activity, or eye movements. Applicable for heart rate variability
  analysis, event-related potentials, complexity measures, autonomic nervous system
  assessment, psychophysiology research, and multi-modal physio...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections for overview, usage
      guidelines, and core capabilities. It provides specific function examples and
      references to documentation. However, it's incomplete (cut off mid-sentence
      in the EEG section), lacks explicit edge case handling, and doesn't define constraints
      or failure modes.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world biosignal analysis tasks across
      multiple domains (cardiac, neural, autonomic, respiratory, muscular). It provides
      concrete code examples and references to detailed workflows, making it immediately
      actionable for researchers and developers working with physiological data.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A comprehensive and well-organized skill prompt for biosignal processing
    that demonstrates strong practical value, though it's incomplete and could benefit
    from more explicit error handling and constraint definitions.
