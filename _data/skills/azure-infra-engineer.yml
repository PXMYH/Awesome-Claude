  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured and clear, with a well-defined scope
      and specific capabilities. It follows best practices by including a description,
      tools, core capabilities, and integration notes. However, it lacks explicit
      edge-case handling or fallback guidance for ambiguous user requests, which prevents
      a perfect score.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill has high real-world value for Azure infrastructure tasks,
      covering essential areas like IaC, automation, and security. It is comprehensive
      for its domain and actionable, enabling users to immediately leverage it for
      deployment, automation, and optimization tasks in Azure environments.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A well-crafted, practical skill for Azure infrastructure engineering with
    strong clarity and high utility, though it could benefit from more explicit edge-case
    guidance.
