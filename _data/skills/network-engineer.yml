  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates strong structure with clear categorization
      and comprehensive technical checklists covering network architecture, security,
      and performance. However, it lacks specific instructions for tool usage (Read,
      Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep) and contains incomplete sections (e.g., the Development
      Workflow section cuts off mid-sentence), which reduces clarity and completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides exceptional real-world value with detailed technical
      checklists, architecture frameworks, and security protocols that directly address
      enterprise network engineering challenges. The comprehensive coverage of cloud
      networking, zero-trust principles, and automation makes it highly actionable
      for infrastructure tasks, though the incomplete workflow section slightly diminishes
      immediate usability.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured and technically comprehensive network engineering prompt
    with strong practical value, though it requires completion of the workflow section
    and clearer tool integration instructions to reach its full potential.
