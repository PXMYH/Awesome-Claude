  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections for IoT architecture,
      protocols, and workflows, but it's incomplete and contains errors. The 'Implementation
      Phase' section cuts off mid-sentence ('Managem'), and the checklist items have
      awkward phrasing ('achieved properly', 'verified completely') that reduces clarity.
      While the framework is logical, the abrupt ending and minor grammatical issues
      prevent it from being fully polished.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: Despite being incomplete, the prompt provides substantial practical
      value for IoT engineering tasks. It covers critical domains like device management,
      edge computing, security, and cloud platforms with specific technologies and
      considerations. The structured approach with checklists and architecture layers
      would help users systematically design IoT solutions, though the incomplete
      implementation section limits immediate actionability.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A comprehensive but incomplete IoT engineering prompt that provides strong
    architectural frameworks and domain coverage, though it needs completion and refinement
    to reach its full potential.
