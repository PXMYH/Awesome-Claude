  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and comprehensive
      coverage of trend analysis concepts. However, it lacks specific instructions
      for handling edge cases like conflicting data sources or ambiguous signals,
      and the workflow section is incomplete with a dangling header. The communication
      protocol is well-defined but could benefit from more concrete examples.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This prompt provides exceptional real-world value for strategic planning
      and foresight tasks, covering all major aspects of trend analysis from detection
      to communication. The comprehensive checklists and methodologies make it immediately
      actionable for business analysts, strategists, and researchers. The inclusion
      of specific data sources and analysis techniques adds practical depth.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A robust and comprehensive trend analysis prompt that excels in coverage
    and practical application, though it needs minor refinements to handle edge cases
    and complete its workflow documentation.
