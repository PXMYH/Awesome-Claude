  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with explicit
      command examples, document ID format guidance, and token management details.
      It defines scope effectively (create, search, read, edit) and includes practical
      constraints like the Google Workspace account requirement. However, it lacks
      explicit error handling guidance for common issues like authentication failures
      or API rate limits.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This provides significant real-world value for users needing lightweight
      Google Docs integration without full MCP server complexity. The standalone OAuth
      authentication and comprehensive command coverage make it immediately actionable
      for document management tasks. However, usefulness is limited by the Google
      Workspace account requirement, excluding personal Gmail users.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-crafted, practical skill prompt that delivers clear Google Docs
    integration with robust authentication handling, though it has some user accessibility
    limitations.
