  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates excellent clarity and specificity, providing
      comprehensive installation instructions, configuration examples, and clear usage
      patterns. It follows best practices by including metadata, license information,
      and structured sections. However, the prompt is truncated mid-sentence in the
      task execution example, which introduces ambiguity about the complete workflow.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill offers exceptional real-world value for biomedical researchers
      by providing an autonomous agent framework that integrates code execution with
      extensive biomedical databases. It covers a wide range of practical applications
      from CRISPR screening to rare disease diagnosis, making it immediately actionable
      for complex research tasks. The comprehensive coverage of multiple biomedical
      domains and supported LLM providers enhances its practical utility.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: Biomni is a highly capable and well-structured biomedical AI agent skill
    that provides comprehensive autonomous research capabilities across genomics,
    drug discovery, and clinical analysis, though the truncated example slightly impacts
    completeness.
