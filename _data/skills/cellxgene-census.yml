  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: 'The prompt provides clear structure with sections for overview, usage,
      installation, and workflow patterns. However, it has a critical flaw: the code
      example in section 3 is incomplete (cuts off mid-function call), which undermines
      clarity. The instructions are generally specific about when to use the skill
      and best practices like using context managers, but the incomplete example creates
      ambiguity about proper usage.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world single-cell genomics tasks,
      covering population-scale queries, dataset exploration, and integration with
      common tools like scanpy. The workflow patterns address actual development needs,
      though the incomplete code example reduces immediate actionability. The skill
      targets a specific, valuable scientific domain with comprehensive metadata and
      expression data access.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured prompt for a valuable scientific skill that provides
    practical single-cell data access, but is undermined by an incomplete code example
    that reduces clarity and immediate usability.
