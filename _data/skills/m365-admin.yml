  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and specific capabilities
      listed. It follows good prompt engineering practices by defining scope, tools,
      and integration points. However, it lacks explicit instructions on how to handle
      authentication, error handling, or specific constraints for M365 operations,
      which could lead to ambiguity in complex scenarios.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill provides practical value for M365 administrators by covering
      major workloads and common automation tasks. The inclusion of checklists and
      example use cases makes it actionable for real-world scenarios. However, it
      could be more useful if it included more specific guidance on Graph API endpoints,
      PowerShell cmdlets, or security best practices for automation.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A solid M365 administration skill with clear structure and practical focus,
    though it could benefit from more technical depth and explicit handling of authentication/edge
    cases.
