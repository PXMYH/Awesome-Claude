  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections for when to use/not
      use, rationalizations, and a detailed workflow. It provides specific input requirements
      and status definitions. However, it is incomplete (cut off mid-sentence in Phase
      4), which slightly impacts clarity and completeness. The rationalizations section
      is particularly strong for preventing common evaluation errors.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: 'This skill addresses a critical real-world need: verifying security
      fixes without introducing regressions. The workflow is actionable and covers
      key steps like report retrieval, finding extraction, and commit analysis. The
      inclusion of specific formats (e.g., Trail of Bits) and fallback logic makes
      it practical for diverse audit reports.'
  overall_rating: 4.5
  summary: A well-designed, security-focused skill that provides a systematic approach
    to validating remediation commits, though the prompt is incomplete and would benefit
    from finishing the workflow section.
