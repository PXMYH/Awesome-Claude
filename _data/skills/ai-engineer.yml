  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear categories and checklists,
      providing excellent specificity on AI engineering domains. However, it lacks
      clarity on execution flow—specifically, how the agent should integrate the listed
      frameworks, tools, and deployment patterns into actionable steps. The communication
      protocol is incomplete, and the development workflow is cut off mid-sentence,
      creating ambiguity in actual implementation.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt offers substantial real-world value by comprehensively covering
      AI system design, from model selection to ethical governance and multi-modal
      deployment. It provides a robust checklist and framework references that guide
      practical development. However, its usefulness is limited by the incomplete
      workflow and unclear integration of tools, which may hinder immediate actionability
      without additional context.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured and comprehensive prompt that excels in breadth and specificity
    for AI engineering but suffers from incomplete sections and unclear execution
    guidance, reducing its immediate practicality.
