  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and specific technical
      domains, but it is incomplete and lacks a defined completion mechanism. The
      workflow section cuts off mid-sentence, and there is no explicit instruction
      on how the agent should conclude its analysis or present findings to the user.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides a comprehensive framework for PostgreSQL optimization,
      covering critical areas like performance tuning, replication, and high availability.
      The inclusion of specific metrics and architecture details makes it highly actionable
      for database administrators.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A technically robust prompt that is strong in scope and detail but suffers
    from structural incompleteness, limiting its immediate operational utility.
