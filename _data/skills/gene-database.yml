  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides clear workflow descriptions and API selection guidance,
      but lacks critical technical specificity. It references script files (query_gene.py,
      fetch_gene_data.py) that appear to be internal implementation details rather
      than user-facing instructions, and the example code snippet is incomplete and
      malformed. The prompt would benefit from actual API endpoint examples, parameter
      specifications, and concrete request/response formats.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill addresses a genuine scientific need for gene database querying
      with practical workflows for search, retrieval, and batch operations. It covers
      common use cases like symbol/ID searches, metadata retrieval, and batch processing
      with useful rate limit guidance. The inclusion of both E-utilities and Datasets
      API options provides flexibility for different query complexities.
  overall_rating: 3.5
  summary: A useful gene database skill with good workflow coverage, but the prompt
    quality is hampered by incomplete technical specifications and reliance on internal
    script references rather than actionable API instructions.
