  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and comprehensive
      checklists covering major cloud architecture domains. However, it lacks specific
      instructions for handling edge cases, such as conflicting requirements or resource
      constraints, and the workflow is incomplete (Discovery Analysis is the only
      phase described).
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides high practical value with extensive checklists
      and frameworks (Well-Architected, 6Rs, etc.) that guide real-world cloud design
      decisions. It covers multi-cloud strategies, cost optimization, and security
      comprehensively, making it immediately actionable for architects.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A robust, comprehensive cloud architect prompt with excellent practical
    frameworks, though incomplete in workflow execution and edge case handling.
