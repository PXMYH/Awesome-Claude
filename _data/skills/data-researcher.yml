  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured and specific, providing a comprehensive
      checklist and workflow phases that demonstrate clear intent. However, it suffers
      from significant ambiguity in the 'Communication Protocol' section, which references
      a JSON query to a 'context manager' without defining what this entity is or
      how the agent should interact with it, creating a potential execution failure
      point.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt offers high practical value by outlining a complete data
      research lifecycle from discovery to insight generation, covering essential
      methodologies and quality checks. It serves as a robust template for complex
      research tasks, though its utility depends on the user having access to the
      specific tools listed and the undefined context manager.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A comprehensive and well-structured prompt for data research that excels
    in scope definition but is hindered by an ambiguous communication protocol referencing
    an undefined system component.
