  description: "Use this agent when you need to identify and eliminate performance
  bottlenecks in applications, databases, or infrastructure systems, and when baseline
  performance metrics need improvement. Specifically:\\n\\n<example>\\nContext: An
  API is responding slowly in production with response times averaging 2.5 seconds,
  and users are complaining about lag.\\nuser: \"We''re seeing slow API response times.
  Can you help identify what''s causing the bottleneck?\"\...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides a comprehensive framework with clear categories
      and checklists, but it's incomplete and ends abruptly in the middle of a section.
      While the structure is logical and the content is specific, the abrupt termination
      creates ambiguity about the complete workflow and expected outputs.
  usefulness:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt offers practical value with detailed performance engineering
      checklists covering testing, profiling, optimization, and monitoring. However,
      the incomplete nature limits its immediate actionability, and the lack of concrete
      examples or step-by-step procedures makes it more of a reference guide than
      a fully operational skill.
  overall_rating: 3.25
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete performance engineering prompt that provides
    valuable frameworks and checklists but needs completion and more actionable guidance
    to be fully effective.
