  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections for overview, usage
      scenarios, and workflows. It provides specific command examples and follows
      good prompt engineering practices with defined scope. However, it lacks explicit
      edge case handling (e.g., missing BAM indices, large file sizes) and has incomplete
      workflow examples that cut off mid-sentence.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This is highly practical for bioinformaticians working with NGS data,
      covering essential tasks like BAM conversion, QC, and visualization. The workflow
      templates and quick reference guidance provide immediate value for common ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq
      analyses. The skill addresses real-world genomics workflows with concrete examples.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-crafted scientific skill prompt that effectively guides NGS data
    analysis with practical workflows, though it needs completion of truncated examples
    and more explicit error handling guidance.
