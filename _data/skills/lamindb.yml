  description: This skill should be used when working with LaminDB, an open-source
  data framework for biology that makes data queryable, traceable, reproducible, and
  FAIR. Use when managing biological datasets (scRNA-seq, spatial, flow cytometry,
  etc.), tracking computational workflows, curating and validating data with biological
  ontologies, building data lakehouses, or ensuring data lineage and reproducibility
  in biological research. Covers data management, annotation, ontologi...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, specific
      use cases, and detailed capability descriptions. It follows best practices by
      providing context, scope, and actionable guidance. The only minor limitation
      is that it references external files (references folder) that aren't included
      in the prompt itself.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for biological data management, covering real-world
      scenarios like scRNA-seq analysis, workflow tracking, and FAIR compliance. It
      provides comprehensive coverage of LaminDB's core features with specific examples
      and integration points with popular tools like Nextflow, W&B, and MLflow.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, comprehensive prompt that effectively introduces LaminDB
    as a scientific data framework with clear value propositions, use cases, and capabilities
    for biological research workflows.
