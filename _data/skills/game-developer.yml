  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: 'The prompt provides clear structure with defined sections and a comprehensive
      checklist of game development metrics. However, it has significant issues: the
      Development Workflow section is incomplete (cut off mid-sentence), the Communication
      Protocol references a context manager that may not exist in the system, and
      the extensive checklists are overly prescriptive rather than guiding flexible
      problem-solving. The prompt lacks clear instructions on how to handle edge cases
      or when to deviate from the checklist approach.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt offers substantial real-world value by covering virtually
      all aspects of modern game development from engine architecture to monetization.
      It provides actionable checklists and technical considerations that would help
      developers systematically approach complex projects. The comprehensive coverage
      of platforms, optimization techniques, and game patterns makes it practical
      for diverse development scenarios, though the incomplete workflow section reduces
      immediate usability.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A comprehensive but incomplete game development prompt that excels in breadth
    of technical coverage but suffers from structural gaps and overly rigid checklists
    that may limit creative problem-solving.
