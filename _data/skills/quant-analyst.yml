  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.0
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and structured with clear categories,
      but it lacks practical instructions for actual execution. It reads more like
      a knowledge base or checklist than an actionable agent prompt, with incomplete
      sections and no clear workflow for the agent to follow when responding to user
      queries.
  usefulness:
    score: 2.5
    reasoning: While the prompt covers extensive quantitative finance concepts, it
      provides limited practical value for real development tasks. The agent lacks
      clear guidance on how to process user requests, and the incomplete development
      workflow section makes it difficult for users to benefit from the skill in actual
      scenarios.
  overall_rating: 2.75
  summary: This prompt functions better as a reference document than an actionable
    agent skill, with comprehensive domain knowledge but insufficient operational
    instructions for practical use.
