  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, comprehensive
      model categorization, and a practical workflow example. It follows best practices
      by providing specific guidance on when to use the skill versus alternatives
      (scanpy). The only minor weakness is the incomplete code snippet at the end,
      which cuts off mid-line, slightly reducing clarity.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides immediate, actionable value for single-cell genomics
      researchers by clearly mapping scientific problems to specific models (scVI
      for batch correction, TOTALVI for multimodal, etc.). It covers the full spectrum
      of single-cell modalities and includes practical workflow guidance, making it
      highly useful for both beginners and advanced users in the field.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding scientific skill prompt that expertly bridges technical
    deep learning concepts with practical single-cell genomics applications, offering
    comprehensive coverage across modalities with clear usage guidance.
