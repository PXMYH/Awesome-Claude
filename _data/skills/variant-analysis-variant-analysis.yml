  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, a
      defined five-step process, and specific tool recommendations. It follows prompt
      engineering best practices by providing explicit when-to-use/when-not-to-use
      guidance and structured decision matrices. However, it's slightly incomplete
      as the 'Critical Pitfalls to Avoid' section cuts off mid-sentence, which slightly
      impacts clarity.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immense real-world value for security professionals
      conducting systematic code audits and vulnerability hunting. It offers a complete,
      actionable methodology that can be immediately applied to find bug variants
      across codebases, with practical guidance on tool selection and triage. The
      structured approach helps analysts avoid common pitfalls like narrow search
      scope.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, highly practical security skill that provides a comprehensive
    methodology for variant analysis with clear steps, tool guidance, and actionable
    principles for finding similar vulnerabilities across codebases.
