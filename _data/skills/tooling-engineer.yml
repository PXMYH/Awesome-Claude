  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections for tool categories,
      architecture, and development workflow. However, it's incomplete - the 'Implementation
      Phase' section cuts off mid-sentence, and the communication protocol is underdeveloped.
      The checklist format provides good specificity, but the prompt lacks concrete
      examples or step-by-step guidance for actual tool development.
  usefulness:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides valuable frameworks for thinking about developer
      tool creation, covering important aspects like performance, UX, and distribution.
      However, its incomplete nature and lack of actionable implementation steps limit
      immediate practical value. The broad scope across multiple tool categories is
      comprehensive but may overwhelm users seeking specific guidance.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-organized but incomplete prompt that provides a solid conceptual
    framework for developer tool creation, though it lacks full implementation guidance
    and concrete examples.
