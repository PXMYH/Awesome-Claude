  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with excellent
      use of markdown for organization and code examples. It defines scope and constraints
      effectively, particularly around when to use Polars vs. alternatives like dask.
      The inclusion of core concepts and common operations provides strong guidance,
      though the prompt is incomplete (cut off mid-sentence in the Aggregations section),
      which slightly impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world data processing tasks, offering
      immediate value for developers migrating from pandas or optimizing data pipelines.
      The prompt comprehensively covers installation, basic usage, core concepts,
      and common operations with actionable code examples. Users can immediately apply
      the provided patterns for data manipulation, filtering, and aggregation.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A well-crafted, highly practical skill prompt that provides excellent guidance
    for using Polars, though it's incomplete and would benefit from finishing the
    Aggregations section and adding error handling examples.
