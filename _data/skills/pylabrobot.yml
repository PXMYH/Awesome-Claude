  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections for overview, usage
      guidelines, and core capabilities. It provides specific hardware examples and
      use cases, making the scope explicit. However, it lacks detailed edge case handling
      (e.g., error scenarios, hardware compatibility limitations) and fallback guidance
      for unsupported equipment.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This skill offers high practical value for lab automation professionals
      working with multi-vendor equipment, providing a unified Python interface that
      reduces vendor lock-in. The comprehensive coverage of liquid handling, resource
      management, and hardware backends addresses real-world workflow complexity.
      The simulation capability and cross-platform support enhance its immediate applicability
      for protocol development and testing.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A robust, well-organized skill for laboratory automation that excels in
    vendor-agnostic control and workflow management, though it could benefit from
    more detailed error handling and edge case documentation.
