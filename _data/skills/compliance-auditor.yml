  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear categories and comprehensive
      checklists, but it's incomplete—the Development Workflow section cuts off mid-sentence
      during 'Test im' and lacks a conclusion. While the compliance frameworks and
      validation criteria are specific, the actual execution instructions are truncated,
      reducing clarity for the agent's operational steps.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides high practical value for compliance auditing with
      detailed regulatory frameworks, validation checklists, and structured protocols.
      However, the incomplete workflow limits immediate actionability, as users cannot
      fully implement the described process without inferring missing steps.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A strong compliance auditing prompt with excellent framework coverage and
    structured protocols, but severely hampered by an incomplete Development Workflow
    section that cuts off mid-sentence, reducing its operational clarity and immediate
    usability.
