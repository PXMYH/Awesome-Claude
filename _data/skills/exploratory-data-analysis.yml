  prompt_quality:
    score: 1.5
    reasoning: The prompt is extremely vague and incomplete, ending abruptly in the
      middle of a section without providing any actual instructions, workflow, or
      analysis steps. It lacks specificity, edge case handling, and best practices,
      making it impossible for an AI to execute the described task.
  usefulness:
    score: 1.0
    reasoning: The prompt is practically useless as it contains no actionable instructions
      for performing exploratory data analysis. While the concept is valuable, the
      prompt fails to provide any guidance on how to detect file types, extract metadata,
      assess quality, or generate reports, rendering it non-functional.
  overall_rating: 1.25
  summary: This is a severely incomplete and poorly structured prompt that fails to
    provide any executable instructions, making it ineffective for its intended purpose
    despite a promising concept.
