  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: 'The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and practical code
      examples, but it contains a critical flaw: the ''DESeq2 Fitting'' code snippet
      is incomplete and syntactically broken, cutting off mid-line. This undermines
      clarity and specificity, as it provides an actionable but erroneous instruction.
      While it includes good metadata and usage guidelines, the incomplete code prevents
      it from being fully reliable without correction.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill is highly practical for bioinformatics tasks, offering a
      complete workflow from data loading to statistical testing with real-world RNA-seq
      examples. It covers essential steps like filtering, design specification, and
      result interpretation, making it immediately actionable for users familiar with
      DESeq2 concepts. The inclusion of multi-factor designs and integration with
      pandas/AnnData adds significant value for Python-based pipelines.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A useful and practical skill for differential expression analysis, but
    the incomplete code snippet in the core workflow reduces prompt quality and reliability.
