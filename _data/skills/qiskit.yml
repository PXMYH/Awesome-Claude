  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections, specific code
      examples, and well-defined references. It follows prompt engineering best practices
      by providing context, examples, and modular references. However, the prompt
      is incomplete (cut off mid-sentence in the 'Hardware Backends' section), which
      slightly impacts clarity and completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The skill provides immediate practical value with installation commands,
      working code examples, and clear guidance for IBM Quantum hardware. It covers
      key quantum computing tasks (circuit building, execution, optimization) comprehensively.
      The modular reference system allows users to dive deeper into specific topics,
      making it highly actionable for real development.
  overall_rating: 4.5
  summary: A well-structured, practical Qiskit skill prompt that excels in clarity
    and real-world applicability, though its incomplete state slightly reduces its
    overall effectiveness.
