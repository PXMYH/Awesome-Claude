  output. This means any task where the user wants to: open, read, edit, or fix an
  existing .xlsx, .xlsm, .csv, or .tsv file (e.g., adding columns, computing formulas,
  formatting, charting, cleaning messy data); create a new spreadsheet from scratch

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and clear, with well-defined standards
      for financial modeling (color coding, formatting, formula construction). It
      provides concrete examples and actionable rules. However, the prompt appears
      incomplete as it cuts off mid-sentence in the pandas code example, which reduces
      clarity for the intended workflow.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The requirements are extremely practical for financial modeling and
      spreadsheet tasks, covering real-world needs like error prevention, documentation
      standards, and industry conventions. The LibreOffice requirement is a practical
      constraint for formula recalculation. The incomplete pandas section limits immediate
      actionability for data analysis workflows.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A strong, detailed prompt for financial spreadsheet standards that provides
    clear, industry-relevant guidelines, but is incomplete and cuts off during the
    technical implementation section.
