  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with a logical
      decision tree, concrete examples, and specific best practices. It effectively
      guides users through common scenarios while warning about pitfalls. The only
      minor limitation is that it assumes the user has access to the specific helper
      scripts mentioned, which may not always be the case.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides immediate, practical value for testing local web
      applications, covering the full workflow from server management to DOM inspection
      and action execution. The inclusion of real code examples, common pitfalls,
      and the reconnaissance-then-action pattern makes it highly actionable for developers
      and testers working with Playwright.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A well-crafted, highly practical prompt that effectively guides users through
    local web application testing with Playwright, offering clear decision trees,
    concrete examples, and actionable best practices.
