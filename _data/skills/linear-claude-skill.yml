  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, specific
      tool availability guidance, and robust security practices. It handles edge cases
      by providing fallback CLI commands when MCP tools are unavailable and includes
      comprehensive setup instructions. The only minor weakness is the truncated content
      at the end, which slightly impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world Linear workflow management,
      covering common operations like issue creation, status updates, and project
      planning. The inclusion of both MCP and CLI backends ensures broad compatibility,
      and the security-focused approach with Varlock integration addresses critical
      production concerns. Users can immediately implement the provided commands and
      scripts.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready skill prompt with strong security practices,
    comprehensive tool support, and clear workflows for Linear project management.
