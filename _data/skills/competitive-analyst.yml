  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates strong structure with clear categories and
      checklists, but lacks completeness in the Development Workflow section which
      cuts off mid-sentence. Instructions are generally clear and specific about the
      analyst's expertise, though the incomplete workflow creates ambiguity about
      execution steps. Best practices are partially followed with systematic categorization,
      but the abrupt ending undermines overall coherence.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides comprehensive frameworks for competitive analysis
      covering multiple dimensions like SWOT, benchmarking, and strategic recommendations,
      making it highly valuable for business intelligence tasks. The structured checklists
      and categories offer practical guidance for systematic analysis, though the
      incomplete workflow limits immediate actionable implementation. Real-world value
      is high for market research and strategic planning scenarios.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured competitive analysis framework with comprehensive categorization
    and strategic depth, but significantly undermined by an incomplete workflow section
    that limits practical execution guidance.
