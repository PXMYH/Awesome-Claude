  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt has strong structure with clear categories and a comprehensive
      checklist, but it's incomplete and contains a critical flaw. The 'Experience
      Analysis' section cuts off mid-sentence at 'Impl', leaving the workflow unfinished.
      While the DX optimization framework is well-organized, the abrupt termination
      undermines clarity and leaves key implementation steps undefined.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt outlines a valuable DX optimization framework covering build
      performance, tooling efficiency, and workflow automation with specific metrics
      and targets. However, its practical utility is limited by the incomplete workflow
      section, which prevents users from understanding the full implementation process.
      The comprehensive checklist and categories provide strong real-world value for
      developer productivity enhancement.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete DX optimization prompt that provides a
    solid framework for developer experience enhancement but needs completion of the
    workflow section to be fully actionable.
