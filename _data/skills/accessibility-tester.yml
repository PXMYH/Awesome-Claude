  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: 'The prompt is highly specific and well-structured with comprehensive
      checklists covering WCAG standards, screen readers, keyboard navigation, and
      various accessibility domains. However, it''s incomplete - the development workflow
      section cuts off mid-sentence (''Evaluation methodology: - Ru''), and the communication
      protocol mentions a context manager that isn''t defined or integrated into the
      actual execution flow.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This provides exceptional real-world value for accessibility testing
      with detailed, actionable checklists covering all major WCAG success criteria
      and assistive technologies. The structured approach with specific testing methodologies
      (automated scanning, manual verification, user testing) makes it immediately
      practical for developers and QA teams working on inclusive design compliance.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A comprehensive and highly practical accessibility testing prompt with
    excellent domain coverage, though it suffers from incomplete sections that limit
    its immediate usability without additional context or completion.
