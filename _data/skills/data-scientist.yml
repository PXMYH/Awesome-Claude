  prompt_quality:
    score: 2.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear categories and checklists,
      demonstrating strong specificity in data science methodologies. However, it
      is incomplete (cut off mid-sentence in the 'Problem evaluation' section) and
      lacks clear instructions on how the agent should actually execute tasks or interact
      with the user, making it ambiguous in practical application.
  usefulness:
    score: 3.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides a comprehensive framework of data science concepts,
      checklists, and workflows that could serve as a valuable reference or mental
      model for an agent. It covers essential domains like statistical modeling, machine
      learning, and business communication, offering practical value for structuring
      data analysis tasks despite the incomplete execution instructions.
  overall_rating: 2.75
  summary: This is a well-structured but incomplete prompt that excels in defining
    data science concepts and methodologies but fails to provide clear operational
    instructions for the agent, limiting its immediate practical utility.
