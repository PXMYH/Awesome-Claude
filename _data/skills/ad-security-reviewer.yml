  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections for
      capabilities, checklists, and integration. It uses specific Active Directory
      terminology and defines a comprehensive scope. However, it lacks explicit handling
      of edge cases like multi-forest environments or hybrid cloud scenarios, and
      doesn't provide fallback guidance for when certain tools or data sources might
      be unavailable.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt delivers high real-world value by addressing critical AD
      security concerns with actionable checklists and deliverables. It comprehensively
      covers identity attack paths, privilege escalation, and domain hardening with
      specific technical areas like LDAP signing, GPO security, and attack surface
      reduction. The integration section with other agents shows practical workflow
      planning for enterprise security operations.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: This is a highly effective security specialist prompt with excellent structure,
    comprehensive coverage of AD security domains, and practical deliverables that
    would immediately benefit security professionals conducting enterprise AD assessments.
