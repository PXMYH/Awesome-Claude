  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates strong clarity and specificity with well-structured
      sections covering prompt architecture, patterns, optimization, and evaluation
      frameworks. It follows best practices by including systematic checklists and
      workflows. However, the implementation phase is incomplete (ends abruptly with
      'Implementation'), which reduces completeness and could cause confusion in execution.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides substantial real-world value for prompt engineering
      tasks, offering comprehensive frameworks for optimization, testing, and production
      deployment. The structured approach with specific metrics and checklists makes
      it highly actionable for developers. The incomplete implementation section slightly
      reduces practical utility, but the overall framework remains robust for professional
      prompt engineering workflows.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured prompt engineering skill with strong frameworks and best
    practices, though incomplete in the implementation phase, making it highly useful
    for systematic prompt development with minor execution gaps.
