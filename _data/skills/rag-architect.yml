  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear role definition,
      specific triggers, and a comprehensive workflow. It follows prompt engineering
      best practices by including constraints (MUST DO/MUST NOT DO) and output templates.
      The only minor weakness is the incomplete Knowledge Reference section at the
      end, which appears truncated.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate, actionable value for developers building
      RAG systems. It covers the entire lifecycle from requirements analysis to evaluation,
      with specific technical guidance on vector databases, chunking, and retrieval
      optimization. The constraints and reference guides make it practical for real-world
      production systems.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready prompt that provides comprehensive guidance
    for RAG system design with clear constraints and actionable workflows.
