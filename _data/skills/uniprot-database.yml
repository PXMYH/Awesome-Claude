  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with specific
      API endpoints, query syntax examples, and practical use cases. It follows excellent
      prompt engineering practices by providing concrete examples and covering core
      capabilities comprehensively. The only minor limitation is that it cuts off
      mid-sentence in the 'Customizing Retrieved Fields' section, which slightly impacts
      completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate, real-world value for bioinformatics
      and protein research workflows. It covers essential UniProt operations including
      searching, retrieval, ID mapping, and batch processing with practical examples.
      The guidance on when to use this skill versus bioservices is particularly valuable
      for developers making architectural decisions.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A high-quality, practical skill prompt that provides comprehensive UniProt
    API access with clear examples and appropriate guidance for both direct REST usage
    and alternative library recommendations.
