  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and specific, with well-defined design
      principles and constraints. It includes comprehensive guidance on color selection,
      typography, and visual hierarchy. However, the prompt is incomplete (cuts off
      mid-sentence in the color palette examples), which slightly impacts its completeness
      and could cause confusion.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate, practical value for creating professional
      presentations without build tools. It covers a wide range of features (themes,
      layouts, code highlighting, animations) that address real-world presentation
      needs. The design-first approach ensures users create polished, context-appropriate
      presentations rather than generic templates.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A highly practical and well-structured prompt for creating reveal.js presentations,
    though it appears to be truncated in the provided content.
