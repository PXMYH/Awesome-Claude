  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured with a specific
      format template and actionable guidelines. It defines scope effectively by focusing
      on documenting skill requests rather than executing tasks. The only minor limitation
      is that it doesn't explicitly address edge cases like duplicate requests or
      how to handle conflicting requests.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This provides high real-world value for teams building AI skills by
      creating a systematic way to capture needs and avoid knowledge gaps. It's actionable
      immediately with the provided template and guidelines. However, its usefulness
      is somewhat limited to collaborative environments where skills are actively
      being developed, rather than individual users.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-crafted, practical prompt that excels at creating a structured system
    for skill request documentation, though its value is primarily for development
    teams rather than end users.
