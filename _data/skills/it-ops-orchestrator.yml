  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and specific, defining a precise
      role, routing logic, and integration points with other agents. It follows best
      practices by providing concrete examples and a structured format. However, it
      lacks explicit fallback guidance for truly ambiguous or out-of-scope tasks,
      which is a minor edge case omission.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This skill has high real-world value for IT operations teams managing
      hybrid environments, as it streamlines complex, multi-domain task routing. It
      is comprehensive for its defined scope and actionable for users needing to delegate
      specialized subtasks. Its utility is slightly limited by the assumption of a
      pre-existing ecosystem of specialized agents.
  overall_rating: 4.5
  summary: A well-structured and highly practical meta-orchestration prompt that excels
    in clarity and real-world applicability for IT operations, with minor room for
    improvement in handling edge cases.
