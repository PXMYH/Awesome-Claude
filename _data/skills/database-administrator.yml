  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and a comprehensive
      checklist, but it is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence in the Development
      Workflow section. While the defined scope and technical depth are strong, the
      abrupt ending creates ambiguity about the expected execution flow and limits
      the prompt's completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt outlines a robust framework for database administration
      with specific, actionable checklists and technical areas (e.g., HA patterns,
      backup strategies). It would be highly valuable for guiding systematic database
      management tasks, though the incomplete workflow section reduces immediate practicality
      for end-to-end execution.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A technically strong and detailed prompt for database administration that
    is hampered by an incomplete workflow section, limiting its full operational utility.
