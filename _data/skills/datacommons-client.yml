  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides clear, structured documentation with specific code
      examples and use cases for each API endpoint. It follows good prompt engineering
      practices by organizing information logically and providing actionable examples.
      However, it lacks explicit edge case handling (e.g., rate limits, error handling,
      empty results) and doesn't define constraints or fallback behaviors for failed
      queries.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This skill offers high real-world value for developers working with
      public statistical data, covering common tasks like demographic analysis, economic
      indicators, and geographic queries. The comprehensive examples and workflow
      patterns make it immediately actionable for data analysis tasks. The inclusion
      of installation instructions and endpoint-specific documentation enhances practical
      utility.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured, practical skill for accessing public statistical data
    through Data Commons, with strong documentation and real-world applicability,
    though it could benefit from more explicit error handling and edge case guidance.
