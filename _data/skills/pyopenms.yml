  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and provides good
      overview of PyOpenMS capabilities. However, it contains incomplete code examples
      (e.g., the Quick Start workflow ends abruptly with 'exp.getSpec' without completion)
      and references external documentation files that don't exist in the prompt context,
      which could confuse users.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides practical value for proteomics and metabolomics
      researchers by covering essential workflows like file I/O, feature detection,
      and peptide identification. It includes installation instructions and core data
      structures, making it actionable for real-world mass spectrometry analysis tasks.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A useful scientific skill prompt for mass spectrometry analysis that covers
    key proteomics workflows, though it needs completion of code examples and resolution
    of references to external documentation.
