  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and comprehensive
      checklists, but it lacks specific instructions on how to execute the workflow.
      The implementation phase is incomplete (cut off mid-sentence), and there's no
      guidance on handling edge cases or when to use specific tools. The communication
      protocol is defined but not integrated into the main workflow.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides excellent frameworks for content marketing strategy
      with comprehensive checklists covering all major aspects. It would be valuable
      for guiding systematic content marketing efforts, though the incomplete implementation
      phase reduces immediate practicality. The structured approach helps ensure thoroughness
      in content marketing activities.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A comprehensive but incomplete content marketing framework with strong
    strategic foundations, though execution guidance is cut off and lacks specific
    tool usage instructions.
