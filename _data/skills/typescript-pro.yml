  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured and specific, clearly defining the
      agent's expertise, tools, and development workflow. It includes comprehensive
      checklists and patterns that guide the agent toward high-quality TypeScript
      development. However, the prompt is incomplete, ending abruptly mid-sentence
      in the 'Development Workflow' section, which introduces ambiguity about the
      full intended process.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is very practical for real-world TypeScript development,
      covering advanced type systems, full-stack safety, and modern tooling that directly
      benefit developers. It provides actionable checklists and patterns that can
      be immediately applied to improve code quality and maintainability. The incompleteness
      slightly reduces its immediate usability, but the existing content is highly
      valuable.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured and expert-level TypeScript prompt with comprehensive
    coverage of advanced patterns and best practices, though it is incomplete and
    cuts off during the workflow description.
