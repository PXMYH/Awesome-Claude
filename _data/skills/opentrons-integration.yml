  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with excellent
      use of code examples and explicit guidance on when to use the skill. It follows
      strong prompt engineering practices by defining metadata, providing concrete
      examples, and covering core capabilities comprehensively. The only minor limitation
      is that it doesn't explicitly address error handling or edge cases in protocol
      execution.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate, high-value guidance for anyone writing
      Opentrons protocols, covering the most common use cases with production-ready
      code examples. It bridges the gap between documentation and practical implementation
      by showing exact syntax for loading hardware, labware, and modules. Users can
      directly apply these patterns to build complex liquid handling workflows without
      extensive prior knowledge.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding scientific skill that delivers comprehensive, production-ready
    guidance for Opentrons protocol development with exceptional clarity and practical
    value.
