  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides a comprehensive framework for chaos engineering
      with clear categories and checklists, but it's incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence
      in the Experiment Phase section. While the structure is logical and follows
      best practices with defined protocols and workflows, the abrupt ending creates
      ambiguity about the complete process and expected outcomes.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt offers high practical value for actual resilience testing
      scenarios with detailed failure injection strategies, blast radius controls,
      and game day planning. It provides actionable frameworks for chaos experiments
      and covers multiple failure domains (infrastructure, application, data, security),
      making it immediately useful for teams implementing chaos engineering practices.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete chaos engineering prompt that provides
    comprehensive frameworks and practical strategies, though the truncated content
    limits its full utility.
