  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear role definition,
      specific workflow steps, and explicit constraints. It follows best practices
      by defining triggers, scope, and output format upfront. The only minor weakness
      is the reference system which relies on external files that may not exist in
      all contexts.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate practical value for developers debugging
      real issues. The systematic workflow (reproduce, isolate, hypothesize, test,
      fix, prevent) mirrors professional debugging practices. The output templates
      ensure actionable results, and the constraints prevent common debugging pitfalls.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent debugging prompt that balances comprehensive methodology with
    practical constraints, making it highly effective for real-world troubleshooting
    scenarios.
