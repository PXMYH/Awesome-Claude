  description: Conduct comprehensive, systematic literature reviews using multiple
  academic databases (PubMed, arXiv, bioRxiv, Semantic Scholar, etc.). This skill
  should be used when conducting systematic literature reviews, meta-analyses, research
  synthesis, or comprehensive literature searches across biomedical, scientific, and
  technical domains. Creates professionally formatted markdown documents and PDFs

  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.0
    reasoning: The prompt has clear structure and defines a comprehensive workflow,
      but contains critical flaws. It references non-existent tools (scientific-schematics,
      gget, bioservices, datacommons-client) and provides incomplete instructions
      (Phase 1 cuts off mid-sentence). The mandatory figure requirement is problematic
      as it depends on unavailable functionality.
  usefulness:
    score: 2.5
    reasoning: While systematic literature reviews are valuable, this prompt is impractical
      due to its dependency on unavailable tools and incomplete workflow. The concept
      is sound but execution is flawed, making it difficult for users to implement
      without significant modification or additional tool integration.
  overall_rating: 2.75
  summary: A well-intentioned but flawed prompt that outlines a comprehensive literature
    review workflow but fails due to incomplete instructions and references to non-existent
    tools and capabilities.
