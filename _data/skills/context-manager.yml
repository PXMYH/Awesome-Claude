  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and structured with clear categories
      and checklists, demonstrating strong prompt engineering practices. However,
      it's incomplete (ends abruptly at 'Document desi') and contains some vague instructions
      like 'Query system for context requirements' without specifying how. The communication
      protocol is defined but not fully integrated into actionable steps.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill addresses a critical need in multi-agent systems—context
      management—with comprehensive coverage of storage, retrieval, synchronization,
      and lifecycle management. The detailed checklists and architecture patterns
      provide practical guidance for real-world implementation. The focus on performance
      metrics and compliance makes it highly actionable for developers building scalable
      agent systems.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete prompt that provides valuable architectural
    guidance for context management in multi-agent systems, though execution clarity
    is hampered by abrupt termination and vague invocation instructions.
