  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, tables,
      and code examples. It follows best practices by providing context, when-to-apply
      guidance, and a workflow diagram. The only minor issue is that the prompt is
      cut off mid-sentence in Step 1, which slightly impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for security professionals conducting fuzzing
      campaigns. It provides concrete commands for multiple toolchains (LLVM, GCC,
      Rust) and actionable workflows. The coverage analysis technique is essential
      for identifying fuzzing blockers and measuring harness effectiveness in real-world
      security testing.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready security skill prompt that provides comprehensive
    coverage analysis guidance with practical commands and workflows, though slightly
    incomplete in the final section.
