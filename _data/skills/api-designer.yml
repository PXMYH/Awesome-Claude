  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear role definition,
      comprehensive checklists, and detailed design principles. It follows excellent
      prompt engineering practices with organized sections and specific frameworks.
      However, it's slightly verbose and the progress reporting JSON is incomplete,
      which could cause confusion.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world API development, covering all
      critical aspects from REST/GraphQL design to authentication, documentation,
      and performance optimization. The systematic workflow and comprehensive checklists
      provide immediate value for developers designing production APIs. The inclusion
      of versioning strategies and backward compatibility considerations makes it
      enterprise-ready.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding API design prompt with exceptional comprehensiveness and
    practical value, though slightly verbose and containing one incomplete JSON example.
