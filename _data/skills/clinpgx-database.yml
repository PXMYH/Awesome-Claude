  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: 'The prompt provides clear structure and good overview of the ClinPGx
      database, with specific use cases and API examples. However, it has significant
      issues: the API endpoint examples are incomplete (truncated code snippet for
      gene-drug pairs), the rate limit section is contradictory (states 2 requests/second
      but doesn''t mention how to handle this in code), and there''s no error handling
      guidance or fallback behavior defined for when the API is unavailable.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill has high practical value for precision medicine and pharmacogenomics
      applications, covering key use cases like gene-drug interactions, CPIC guidelines,
      and clinical decision support. The API examples are concrete and actionable,
      though the incomplete code snippet reduces immediate usability. The real-world
      applications in clinical pharmacology and personalized dosing make it highly
      relevant for healthcare and pharmaceutical development tasks.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-intentioned pharmacogenomics database skill with strong real-world
    applicability, but hampered by incomplete code examples and missing error handling
    guidance that would be crucial for production use.
