  description: Use when auditing a codebase for semantic duplication - functions that
  do the same thing but have different names or implementations. Especially useful
  for LLM-generated codebases where new functions are often created rather than reusing

  # Finding Duplicate-Intent Functions


  ## Overview


  LLM-generated codebases accumulate semantic duplicates: functions that serve the
  same purpose but were implemented independently. Classical...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear phases, specific
      tool references, and a visual workflow diagram. It provides concrete commands,
      options, and expected outputs. However, it's incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence
      in the High-Risk Duplicate Zones table) and assumes external scripts exist without
      providing their implementation details.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This addresses a real and painful problem in LLM-generated codebases
      where semantic duplicates proliferate. The two-phase approach (classical + LLM
      intent analysis) is sophisticated and practical. The workflow is actionable
      with clear steps, and the focus on high-risk zones provides targeted value for
      developers.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A highly practical and well-designed skill for detecting semantic duplicates
    in codebases, particularly valuable for LLM-generated code, though the prompt
    itself is incomplete and relies on external scripts.
