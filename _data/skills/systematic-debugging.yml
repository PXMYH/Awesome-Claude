  # Systematic Debugging


  ## Overview


  Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.


  **Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes
  are failure.


  **Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**


  ## The Iron Law

  NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured with a strong
      logical flow from principles to actionable phases. It provides specific, concrete
      examples (like the multi-layer system debugging) and handles edge cases by explicitly
      stating when to use it (especially under pressure). The only minor weakness
      is that Phase 2 appears incomplete in the provided content, which slightly impacts
      completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world development, offering a systematic
      framework that prevents common debugging pitfalls like premature fixes. The
      emphasis on root cause analysis before solutions is universally valuable, and
      the concrete examples (like tracing data flow) make it immediately actionable
      for developers at any level.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, comprehensive debugging prompt that enforces disciplined
    problem-solving with clear phases and practical examples, though Phase 2 appears
    truncated in the provided content.
