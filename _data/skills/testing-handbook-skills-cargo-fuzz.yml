  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections, good formatting,
      and specific examples. It provides excellent guidance on when to use cargo-fuzz
      versus alternatives, includes installation steps, and demonstrates harness writing.
      However, it's incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence in the 'Running Campaigns' section),
      which slightly impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for Rust developers needing to fuzz their
      code, covering real-world scenarios like project structure, harness writing,
      and performance optimization. It provides actionable commands and best practices.
      The main limitation is the incomplete content, which leaves out some important
      information about running campaigns.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A solid, practical skill for Rust fuzzing that provides clear guidance
    and actionable examples, though it's incomplete and missing the final section
    on running campaigns.
