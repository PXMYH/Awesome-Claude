  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and provides specific
      code examples for common use cases. However, it contains a critical flaw in
      the 'Query Workflow' section where the code snippet is incomplete (ends abruptly
      with 'targets'), and lacks error handling, rate limiting guidance, or fallback
      strategies for API failures.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The skill provides high practical value for medicinal chemistry and
      drug discovery research, covering essential queries like compound searches,
      bioactivity data retrieval, and structure-based searches. The comprehensive
      examples and real-world use cases make it immediately actionable for researchers
      working with ChEMBL data.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A highly useful scientific skill for drug discovery with strong practical
    examples, but needs completion of the workflow section and addition of error handling
    to reach full quality.
