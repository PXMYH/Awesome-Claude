  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections for
      overview, usage, installation, and core capabilities. It provides specific,
      executable code examples for each major feature (rules, structural alerts, functional
      API) and includes practical details like parallelization and progress bars.
      The only minor weakness is that it doesn't explicitly address error handling
      or edge cases for invalid SMILES strings.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill addresses a critical need in drug discovery workflows with
      comprehensive, production-ready functionality. It covers the full spectrum of
      medicinal chemistry filtering from established rules (Lipinski, Veber) to advanced
      structural alerts (NIBR, Lilly) and includes practical features like parallel
      processing. The examples are immediately actionable for real compound library
      triage and prioritization tasks.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready medicinal chemistry skill that provides
    comprehensive molecular filtering capabilities with clear documentation and practical
    examples for drug discovery workflows.
