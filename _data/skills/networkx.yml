  description: Comprehensive toolkit for creating, analyzing, and visualizing complex
  networks and graphs in Python. Use when working with network/graph data structures,
  analyzing relationships between entities, computing graph algorithms (shortest paths,
  centrality, clustering), detecting communities, generating synthetic networks, or
  visualizing network topologies. Applicable to social networks, biological networks,
  transportation systems, citation networks, and any domain inv...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured with comprehensive
      coverage of NetworkX capabilities, including graph types, algorithms, and generators.
      It follows best practices by providing concrete code examples and referencing
      external documentation. The only minor limitation is that the prompt cuts off
      mid-sentence in the graph generators section, which slightly impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate practical value for anyone working with
      network data, covering the most common use cases from graph creation to advanced
      analysis. The inclusion of specific algorithm examples (shortest paths, centrality,
      community detection) makes it highly actionable for real-world tasks. The comprehensive
      scope ensures users can handle diverse network analysis scenarios across multiple
      domains.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A well-crafted, comprehensive NetworkX skill prompt that provides clear
    guidance for graph creation, analysis, and visualization with practical examples,
    making it highly useful for scientific and data analysis tasks.
