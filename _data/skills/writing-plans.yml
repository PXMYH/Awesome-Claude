  # Writing Plans


  ## Overview


  Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the engineer has zero context
  for our codebase and questionable taste. Document everything they need to know:
  which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check,
  how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent
  commits.

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and specific, defining exact file
      paths, code snippets, and commands. It follows strong prompt engineering practices
      by setting explicit constraints (zero context, questionable taste) and providing
      a rigid structure. The only minor deduction is for the slightly ambiguous 'questionable
      taste' assumption, which could be interpreted differently.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immense real-world value for complex development
      tasks by enforcing TDD, DRY, and YAGNI principles. It comprehensively covers
      implementation from test to commit, making it highly actionable for engineers.
      The execution handoff options add practical flexibility for different workflow
      preferences.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding prompt that creates a rigorous, executable implementation
    plan with exceptional clarity and practical utility for software development.
