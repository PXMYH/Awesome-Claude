  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with specific
      technical constraints for Slack optimization (dimensions, FPS, colors). It provides
      concrete code examples and actionable guidance for both image handling and drawing
      from scratch. The only minor limitation is that it assumes certain utilities
      exist (like GIFBuilder and validators) without explaining their implementation.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate practical value for creating Slack-optimized
      GIFs with specific technical requirements. It covers the complete workflow from
      frame generation to optimization, addressing real-world constraints like file
      size and platform compatibility. The guidance on visual design and polish elevates
      it beyond basic functionality to professional-quality output.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready skill that balances technical precision
    with creative guidance, providing everything needed to create professional Slack
    GIFs while maintaining optimal performance characteristics.
