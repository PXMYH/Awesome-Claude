  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates excellent clarity and specificity with well-structured
      principles, clear examples of right vs. wrong interpretations, and specific
      handling instructions for different input formats. It includes important edge
      cases like the L/I exception and provides concrete guidance on data extraction.
      The only minor weakness is the PDF extraction command references a specific
      script path that may not exist in all environments.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill addresses a specialized but valuable niche in HR and organizational
      development, providing concrete frameworks for interpreting Culture Index data
      that would be difficult for non-experts to apply correctly. The comprehensive
      coverage of use cases (hiring, team composition, burnout detection, conflict
      mediation) makes it highly actionable for professionals working with behavioral
      assessments. However, its utility is limited to organizations that specifically
      use Culture Index assessments.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-crafted, expert-level prompt that provides sophisticated guidance
    for interpreting Culture Index behavioral assessments with clear principles, practical
    examples, and comprehensive input handling, though its specialized focus limits
    broader applicability.
