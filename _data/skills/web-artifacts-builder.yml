  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured and specific, providing clear step-by-step
      instructions, a defined tech stack, and explicit design guidelines to avoid
      common pitfalls. It includes actionable commands and explains what each script
      does, which reduces ambiguity. However, it assumes the existence of specific
      scripts and a pre-configured environment without detailing how those are created
      or what to do if they fail.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill is highly practical for developers needing to create complex,
      stateful web artifacts within Claude, leveraging modern frameworks like React
      and shadcn/ui. It streamlines the process from initialization to bundling, making
      it immediately actionable for building sophisticated UIs. Its usefulness is
      limited to users who need multi-component artifacts, as it explicitly advises
      against using it for simple single-file HTML.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured and practical skill for building complex web artifacts
    with modern frontend tools, though it relies on assumed pre-existing scripts and
    environment setup.
