  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections for overview, capabilities,
      and usage guidelines. It provides specific examples and actionable instructions
      for different search types. However, it is incomplete (cut off mid-sentence)
      and lacks explicit error handling or fallback strategies for failed searches.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This skill offers high practical value for metabolomics researchers,
      clinicians, and bioinformaticians by providing direct access to a comprehensive
      metabolite database. It covers diverse use cases from identification to biomarker
      discovery with specific search methodologies. The inclusion of licensing terms
      and download options enhances real-world applicability for academic and commercial
      users.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A robust, well-documented skill for metabolomics research that provides
    clear access to HMDB's extensive metabolite data, though it is incomplete and
    could benefit from error-handling guidance.
