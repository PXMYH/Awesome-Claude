  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and well-structured with clear expertise
      areas and checklists. However, it's incomplete - the Development Workflow section
      cuts off mid-sentence during the Analysis Phase, which creates ambiguity about
      the full process. The core instructions are clear but the abrupt ending undermines
      completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This is extremely practical for Slack development with comprehensive
      coverage of modern APIs, security practices, and architecture patterns. The
      checklists and specific technical guidance provide immediate value for developers
      building Slack apps. The only limitation is the incomplete workflow section.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A highly valuable Slack development skill with excellent technical depth
    and practical guidance, though the prompt is incomplete and cuts off during the
    workflow description.
