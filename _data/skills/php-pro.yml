  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections for expertise areas
      and a defined workflow, demonstrating strong prompt engineering. However, it
      is incomplete (cut off mid-sentence in the Architecture Analysis section), which
      introduces ambiguity about the full intended workflow and limits its clarity.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides comprehensive coverage of modern PHP development
      practices, frameworks, and tools, making it highly valuable for enterprise-level
      PHP tasks. It is actionable for developers seeking expert guidance, though the
      incomplete workflow reduces immediate practicality for the full development
      lifecycle.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A robust and well-organized PHP expert prompt that excels in specificity
    and coverage of modern PHP ecosystem, but is hampered by an incomplete structure
    that limits its full utility.
