  description: This skill should be used for time series machine learning tasks including
  classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, anomaly detection, segmentation,
  and similarity search. Use when working with temporal data, sequential patterns,
  or time-indexed observations requiring specialized algorithms beyond standard ML
  approaches. Particularly suited for univariate and multivariate time series analysis
  with scikit-learn compatible APIs.

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections for overview, usage,
      and installation, and provides specific code examples for core capabilities.
      However, it is incomplete (cut off mid-sentence in the Similarity Search section)
      and lacks explicit edge-case handling or fallback guidance for errors like missing
      dependencies or data format issues.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill offers high real-world value for time series ML tasks, covering
      a comprehensive range of applications like classification, forecasting, and
      anomaly detection with scikit-learn compatibility. The quick-start code snippets
      are immediately actionable, enabling users to implement state-of-the-art algorithms
      efficiently.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A highly practical and well-organized skill prompt for time series machine
    learning, though it requires completion and minor enhancements for robustness.
