  description: Structured hypothesis formulation from observations. Use when you have
  experimental observations or data and need to formulate testable hypotheses with
  predictions, propose mechanisms, and design experiments to test them. Follows scientific
  method framework. For open-ended ideation use scientific-brainstorming; for automated
  LLM-driven hypothesis testing on datasets use hypogenic.

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: 'The prompt demonstrates strong clarity and specificity with a well-structured
      workflow and clear constraints. However, it contains a significant inconsistency:
      it references a ''scientific-schematics'' skill and a ''Nano Banana Pro'' system
      that are not defined in the allowed-tools list, creating ambiguity about execution.
      The workflow is comprehensive but the literature search section is incomplete,
      cutting off mid-sentence.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill addresses a genuine scientific need for structured hypothesis
      generation with practical workflow steps. The mandatory visualization requirement
      enhances real-world value for scientific communication. However, the incomplete
      literature search section and undefined external dependencies reduce immediate
      actionability for users.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured scientific hypothesis generation skill with strong workflow
    design, but undermined by incomplete sections and references to undefined external
    systems, requiring refinement for full practicality.
