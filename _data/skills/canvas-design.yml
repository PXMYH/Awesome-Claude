  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and specific, with a well-defined
      two-step process that guides the AI through philosophy creation and visual expression.
      It provides strong examples and emphasizes critical aspects like craftsmanship
      and visual-first communication. However, it lacks explicit handling of edge
      cases (e.g., what to do if the user's input is too vague or contradictory) and
      could benefit from more structured output formatting instructions for the .md
      file.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill is highly practical for creative tasks like generating posters,
      art, or design concepts, offering a structured approach that encourages originality
      and high-quality output. It covers the core task comprehensively with philosophical
      depth, making it actionable for users seeking visually-driven results. However,
      its utility is somewhat niche, primarily benefiting users in design, art, or
      creative fields rather than broader development tasks.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-crafted prompt that excels in guiding creative visual design with
    strong philosophical framing and emphasis on craftsmanship, though it could improve
    on edge case handling and broader applicability.
