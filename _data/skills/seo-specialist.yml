  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: 'The prompt is well-structured with clear sections for communication
      protocol, execution flow, and specific SEO processes. It follows good prompt
      engineering practices with structured JSON formats and defined workflows. However,
      it has some issues: the ''SEO tools mastery'' section is incomplete (ends with
      a dash), and the context request payload could be more specific about what data
      is needed rather than a generic list.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real SEO work, covering comprehensive
      areas like technical audits, content strategy, competitor analysis, and performance
      metrics. The structured approach with specific checklists (crawl errors, performance
      optimization elements) makes it immediately actionable. The inclusion of status
      updates and completion documentation adds significant value for professional
      SEO workflows.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-designed SEO specialist prompt with strong practical value and clear
    structure, though it contains a minor formatting issue in the tools section and
    could benefit from more specific data requirements in the context request.
