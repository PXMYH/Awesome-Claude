  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates strong clarity and specificity with well-defined
      role, workflow, and constraints. It includes comprehensive 'MUST DO' and 'MUST
      NOT DO' sections that provide clear guardrails. The reference system is innovative
      but relies on external files that may not exist, which could limit practical
      implementation.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: High practical value for developers working with Atlassian tools, covering
      authentication, queries, and common workflows. The prompt is actionable with
      specific technical details like JQL/CQL, OAuth 2.1, and rate limiting. However,
      the dependency on external reference files reduces immediate usability without
      access to those resources.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured, technically detailed prompt for Atlassian MCP integration
    that balances comprehensive guidance with practical constraints, though its effectiveness
    depends on access to referenced documentation files.
