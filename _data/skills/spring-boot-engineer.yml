  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt has strong structure with clear categories and technical
      depth, but suffers from incomplete sections and abrupt termination. The checklist
      and feature lists are comprehensive, but the development workflow section cuts
      off mid-sentence, creating ambiguity about expected execution flow.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: Highly practical for Spring Boot development with extensive coverage
      of modern features, microservices patterns, and enterprise requirements. The
      comprehensive checklists and feature lists provide concrete guidance, though
      the incomplete workflow section reduces immediate actionability.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A technically robust Spring Boot engineer prompt with excellent domain
    coverage, but needs completion of the truncated workflow section and refinement
    of ambiguous instructions to reach full potential.
