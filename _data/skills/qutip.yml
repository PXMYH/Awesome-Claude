  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections for
      installation, quick start, and core capabilities. It provides specific code
      examples for each major feature and includes helpful references to detailed
      documentation. However, the prompt is incomplete (ends abruptly at '5. A'),
      which prevents a perfect score.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for quantum physics research and education,
      covering essential tools for open quantum systems, master equations, and quantum
      optics. The prompt immediately actionable with working code examples and clear
      guidance on when to use QuTiP versus other quantum libraries. The inclusion
      of solver selection guides and specific use cases makes it valuable for both
      beginners and experienced researchers.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A comprehensive and well-structured prompt for the QuTiP quantum simulation
    library, though incomplete, that provides excellent practical value for quantum
    physics research and education with clear examples and guidance.
