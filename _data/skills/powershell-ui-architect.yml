  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections and specific technical
      guidance. It defines scope, constraints, and architecture patterns effectively.
      The only minor weakness is the incomplete sentence at the end ('Get-* and Set-*
      com'), which slightly impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides exceptional real-world value for PowerShell developers
      building UIs. It covers comprehensive scenarios from WinForms to WPF/Metro and
      TUIs, with practical architecture guidance. The actionable patterns and technology
      recommendations would immediately help developers create maintainable UI tools.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, well-structured prompt that provides comprehensive guidance
    for PowerShell UI development across multiple frameworks with strong architectural
    principles.
