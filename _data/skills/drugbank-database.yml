  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and specific capabilities,
      but it's incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence in the 'Drug Targets and Pathways'
      section). The instructions are specific about use cases and reference documentation,
      though the actual implementation details are missing, which limits clarity on
      what the skill will actually do.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill addresses a real need in pharmaceutical research and drug
      discovery, covering comprehensive data access and analysis. However, the incomplete
      nature and lack of actual implementation code or specific function definitions
      reduce immediate practicality for users.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete skill prompt that outlines valuable pharmaceutical
    data analysis capabilities, though it lacks implementation details and is cut
    off mid-documentation.
