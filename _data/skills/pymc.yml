  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, following a
      logical Bayesian workflow from data preparation through diagnostics. It provides
      specific code examples and parameter recommendations, though it references a
      custom diagnostic script that may not exist in the user's environment, which
      could cause confusion.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world Bayesian modeling tasks, covering
      the complete workflow from model building to validation and comparison. It provides
      actionable code snippets for each step, addresses common pitfalls like standardizing
      predictors, and includes modern PyMC 5.x+ features like named dimensions and
      variational inference.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready skill prompt that provides comprehensive
    guidance for Bayesian modeling with PyMC, though it should clarify the custom
    diagnostic script dependency.
