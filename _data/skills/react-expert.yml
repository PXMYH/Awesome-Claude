  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear role definition,
      specific constraints, and a comprehensive reference system. It follows best
      practices by defining triggers, scope, and output format. The only minor weakness
      is the external reference files which may not be accessible to all users, potentially
      limiting immediate usability.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate, high-value guidance for real-world React
      development, covering modern patterns like Server Components and React 19 features.
      The workflow is actionable and comprehensive, addressing common pain points
      like performance optimization and state management. The constraints and templates
      ensure production-ready output.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready prompt that demonstrates deep expertise
    in modern React development with clear structure and practical guidance.
