  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear role definition,
      specific workflow steps, and comprehensive constraints. It follows best practices
      by defining triggers, scope, and output format upfront. The only minor limitation
      is the dependency on external reference files that may not exist in all contexts.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides tremendous real-world value by structuring the
      complex process of feature definition into a systematic workflow. It covers
      the full lifecycle from discovery to implementation planning, making it immediately
      actionable for product teams. The dual PM/Dev perspective ensures comprehensive
      requirements that address both user needs and technical constraints.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding prompt that transforms feature definition into a structured,
    repeatable process with clear roles, workflows, and deliverables, making it highly
    valuable for development teams.
