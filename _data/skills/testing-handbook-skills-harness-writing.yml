  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections, tables, and code
      examples that follow good prompt engineering practices. It defines key concepts,
      provides a quick reference, and offers step-by-step guidance. However, it is
      incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence in Step 3), which slightly impacts clarity
      and completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill provides practical, actionable guidance for writing fuzzing
      harnesses, covering common languages (C++, Rust) and real-world scenarios like
      input validation and target selection. It would be valuable for developers starting
      with fuzzing or improving coverage, though the incomplete step reduces its immediate
      usability.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured and practical guide for writing fuzzing harnesses, but
    the incomplete content limits its full potential as a ready-to-use skill.
