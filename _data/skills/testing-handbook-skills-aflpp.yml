  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, tables
      for comparison, and practical code examples. Instructions are specific and actionable,
      covering installation, usage, and security warnings. The only minor issue is
      the incomplete command in the System Configuration section (missing closing
      backtick).
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides comprehensive, real-world guidance for using AFL++
      effectively. It covers installation methods, usage patterns, and critical security
      considerations. The comparison table helps users choose the right fuzzer, and
      the wrapper script is immediately usable for practical fuzzing campaigns.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready prompt that balances technical depth with
    practical usability, providing everything needed to start fuzzing with AFL++ while
    emphasizing important security considerations.
