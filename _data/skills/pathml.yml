  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, specific
      capability descriptions, and organized reference links. It follows best practices
      by defining scope, use cases, and core capabilities upfront. However, it lacks
      explicit edge case handling (e.g., memory constraints, format compatibility
      issues) and fallback guidance for when the skill might not be appropriate.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for computational pathology workflows, covering
      real-world tasks like WSI analysis, multiplex imaging, and ML model training.
      The comprehensive capability breakdown with specific model names (HoVer-Net,
      HACTNet) and platform support (CODEX, Vectra) makes it immediately actionable
      for researchers and developers in the field.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding, production-ready skill prompt that provides comprehensive
    coverage of computational pathology workflows with clear structure and practical
    guidance for advanced WSI analysis.
