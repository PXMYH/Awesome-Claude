  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates strong technical specificity with comprehensive
      checklists covering GraphQL best practices, federation, and optimization strategies.
      However, it's incomplete (cut off mid-sentence in the implementation section)
      and lacks clear action instructions for the agent to execute, making it more
      of a reference guide than an operational prompt.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides exceptional real-world value for GraphQL architecture
      with detailed coverage of federation, subscriptions, and performance optimization.
      It's highly actionable for developers designing distributed GraphQL systems,
      though the incomplete structure limits immediate execution without additional
      context or completion.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A technically excellent but incomplete GraphQL architecture prompt that
    provides comprehensive best practices and checklists, though it needs completion
    and clearer execution instructions to be fully operational.
