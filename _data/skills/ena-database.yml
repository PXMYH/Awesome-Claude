  prompt_quality:
    score: 2.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides good structural organization and clear categorization
      of ENA data types, but lacks critical implementation details. It references
      external documentation files that don't exist in the prompt context, creating
      dependency issues. The example API query is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence,
      which significantly undermines clarity and usability.
  usefulness:
    score: 3.0
    reasoning: The skill addresses a genuine need in bioinformatics for accessing
      public nucleotide sequence data, which has real-world value for research and
      pipeline development. However, the incomplete API examples and missing practical
      code snippets reduce immediate actionability. The comprehensive overview of
      ENA's data hierarchy and access methods provides a solid foundation for users
      familiar with programmatic data retrieval.
  overall_rating: 2.75
  summary: This is a well-structured but incomplete skill prompt that provides valuable
    conceptual framework for ENA database access but fails to deliver practical implementation
    guidance due to missing code examples and external references.
