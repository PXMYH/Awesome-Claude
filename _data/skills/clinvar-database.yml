  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with excellent
      organization into logical sections (overview, when to use, core capabilities).
      It provides specific search syntax examples and API usage patterns. However,
      it references external documentation files that don't exist in the prompt itself,
      which could limit standalone utility.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill provides high practical value for genomic medicine and bioinformatics
      tasks, covering essential ClinVar operations from web queries to programmatic
      access. The inclusion of real API examples and classification interpretation
      guidelines makes it immediately actionable. The limitation is the dependency
      on referenced external documentation files that aren't included.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-crafted, practical skill for ClinVar database interaction that balances
    technical depth with usability, though it would be more complete if it included
    the referenced documentation files rather than just pointing to them.
