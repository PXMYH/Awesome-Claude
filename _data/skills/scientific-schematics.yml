  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and provides specific
      examples for different document types, which is good for clarity. However, it
      contains significant inconsistencies and unrealistic claims, such as referencing
      non-existent tools (Nano Banana Pro AI, Gemini 3 Pro, OpenRouter API) and a
      script (generate_schematic.py) that likely doesn't exist in the user's environment.
      The prompt lacks proper error handling for missing dependencies or API failures.
  usefulness:
    score: 2.0
    reasoning: While the concept of generating scientific diagrams is valuable, the
      prompt is practically unusable as described because it relies on fictional AI
      models and tools that aren't available. The quality threshold system is conceptually
      interesting but not implementable with the given instructions. Users would need
      significant modification to make this work with real tools.
  overall_rating: 2.75
  summary: This prompt has good structural organization and clear intent but is fundamentally
    flawed due to its reliance on non-existent AI models and tools, making it impractical
    for real-world use without substantial modification.
