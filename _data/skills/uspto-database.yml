  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides a comprehensive overview of USPTO APIs and their
      use cases, but it is incomplete and contains a truncated code example that cuts
      off mid-sentence. While the structure is logical and the information is specific,
      the lack of completion and the abrupt ending reduce clarity and usability. It
      follows some prompt engineering best practices by defining scope and use cases,
      but fails to provide actionable, complete instructions.
  usefulness:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The skill has high real-world value for IP analysis and patent research,
      covering a wide range of APIs and use cases. However, the incomplete code examples
      and missing implementation details limit immediate actionability. A user would
      need to fill in gaps or seek additional resources to fully utilize the skill,
      reducing its practical completeness.
  overall_rating: 3.25
  summary: This is a valuable but incomplete skill prompt that provides excellent
    context on USPTO APIs but fails to deliver fully functional code examples, limiting
    its immediate usability despite strong conceptual coverage.
