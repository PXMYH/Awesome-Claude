  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear steps, specific commands,
      and excellent handling of edge cases like test failures and confirmation requirements.
      It follows strong prompt engineering practices with explicit verification steps
      and decision trees. The only minor weakness is the incomplete 'Integration'
      section at the end, which feels like a placeholder.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill addresses a real, common pain point in development workflows
      - the uncertainty of what to do when a feature branch is complete. It provides
      immediate, actionable value by guiding users through a structured process with
      concrete commands and clear options. The inclusion of test verification, PR
      creation, and cleanup makes it comprehensive for actual development tasks.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready skill that provides clear, actionable guidance
    for completing development work with strong safety mechanisms and real-world applicability.
