  prompt_quality:
    score: 2.5
    reasoning: 'The prompt is highly specific about .NET Framework 4.8 technologies
      and includes comprehensive checklists for various components like Web Forms,
      WCF, and Windows services. However, it contains a critical flaw: the communication
      protocol section is incomplete and cuts off mid-sentence, which would cause
      execution failures. The prompt also lacks clear instructions on how to handle
      the context manager query or what to do when project context is unavailable.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates deep domain knowledge of legacy enterprise
      .NET development with detailed coverage of Web Forms, WCF services, Entity Framework
      6, and enterprise patterns. It provides practical value for maintaining and
      modernizing legacy systems, which is a common enterprise need. The comprehensive
      checklists and feature lists would help developers ensure they're using appropriate
      patterns and avoiding common pitfalls in legacy codebases.
  overall_rating: 3.25
  summary: A technically strong prompt with excellent domain expertise in legacy .NET
    Framework development, but severely undermined by an incomplete communication
    protocol section that would prevent proper execution.
