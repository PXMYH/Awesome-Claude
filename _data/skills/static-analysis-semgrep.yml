  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, tables,
      and code examples. It provides specific guidance on when to use/not use Semgrep,
      installation methods, and practical workflows. The only minor weakness is the
      incomplete custom rule example (ends abruptly with 're'), but the overall clarity
      and specificity are excellent.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world security scanning tasks. It
      covers the complete workflow from installation to custom rule writing, includes
      specific ruleset recommendations, and addresses common scenarios like CI/CD
      integration. The comparison with CodeQL helps users make informed tool choices.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding security skill prompt that balances comprehensive technical
    detail with practical guidance, making it immediately actionable for developers
    and security engineers.
