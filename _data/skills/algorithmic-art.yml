  description: Creating algorithmic art using p5.js with seeded randomness and interactive
  parameter exploration. Use this when users request creating art using code, generative
  art, algorithmic art, flow fields, or particle systems. Create original algorithmic
  art rather than copying existing artists'' work to avoid copyright violations.

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and specific, with well-defined two-step
      processes and concrete deliverables (.md, .html, .js files). It provides strong
      creative constraints (avoiding copyright, emphasizing algorithmic expression)
      and includes detailed guidance on philosophy creation. However, it lacks explicit
      edge case handling for user inputs that don't fit the generative art paradigm,
      and the 'craftsmanship' emphasis, while clear, could be seen as overly prescriptive
      rather than a best practice.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill has high real-world value for creating original algorithmic
      art, which is a common creative coding task. It comprehensively covers the generative
      art creation pipeline from concept to implementation. The actionable output
      format (interactive viewer + code) provides immediate utility for developers
      and artists, though the scope is somewhat niche compared to broader coding tasks.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured, highly specific prompt that effectively guides the creation
    of original algorithmic art through a philosophy-to-code pipeline, though it could
    benefit from more flexible handling of diverse user inputs.
