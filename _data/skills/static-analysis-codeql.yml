  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections for
      when to use/not use CodeQL, installation steps, and core workflows. It provides
      specific commands and a helpful comparison table for different languages. However,
      the custom query section is incomplete (ends abruptly), which slightly reduces
      clarity and completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world security auditing tasks, covering
      the complete workflow from installation to analysis. The inclusion of Trail
      of Bits queries and SARIF/CSV output options adds significant value for professional
      security work. The interprocedural analysis explanation effectively communicates
      CodeQL's unique value proposition compared to simpler tools.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready security skill prompt that comprehensively
    covers CodeQL usage with practical commands and clear guidance, though it needs
    completion of the custom query section.
