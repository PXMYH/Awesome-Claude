  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and specific, providing a structured
      workflow and a detailed list of 11 categories with 50+ rules for analysis. It
      effectively defines the skill's activation triggers and scope. The only minor
      deduction is that the prompt content is truncated at the end, leaving the 'Functions'
      category incomplete, which slightly impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill has high real-world value for developers working with the
      Move language, especially given the recent Move 2024 Edition updates. It provides
      actionable, specific feedback based on official checklists, covering a comprehensive
      range of code quality aspects from manifest configuration to syntax best practices.
      The structured workflow ensures thorough analysis.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A high-quality, highly useful prompt that provides a comprehensive framework
    for automated Move code review, though it is slightly incomplete due to truncation.
