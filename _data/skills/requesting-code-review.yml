  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear sections, specific commands,
      and a concrete example. It defines mandatory vs. optional review triggers and
      provides actionable steps. The only minor weakness is the reference to an external
      template file that isn't included in the prompt itself, which could create a
      dependency issue.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides exceptional real-world value by integrating code
      review into the development workflow at critical points. It's immediately actionable
      with specific git commands and subagent dispatch instructions. The guidance
      on handling feedback and red flags makes it practical for preventing bugs and
      maintaining code quality.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready prompt that effectively institutionalizes
    code review as a mandatory part of the development workflow with clear triggers,
    actions, and quality gates.
