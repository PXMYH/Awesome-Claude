  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, specific
      method names, and logical organization. It follows best practices by providing
      both quick templates and detailed documentation references. The only minor weakness
      is that the prompt is truncated mid-sentence in the distributed training section,
      which slightly impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is a highly practical and valuable skill for any PyTorch Lightning
      developer. It covers all major components (LightningModule, Trainer, DataModule,
      Callbacks, Logging, Distributed Training) with actionable guidance and references
      to specific files/scripts. The skill enables immediate application in real-world
      deep learning projects.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, comprehensive PyTorch Lightning skill prompt that provides
    clear structure, practical templates, and references to detailed documentation,
    making it highly valuable for developers building scalable neural networks.
