  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections for authentication,
      core operations, and membership management. It provides practical TypeScript
      examples for key Whop API endpoints. However, the prompt is incomplete (cuts
      off mid-example in the Courses section) and lacks error handling guidance, rate
      limiting information, and edge case considerations.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: Highly practical for developers building Whop integrations, covering
      essential operations like product creation, checkout, membership validation,
      and payment processing. The real-world code snippets are immediately actionable
      for SaaS and course platform development. The incomplete courses section slightly
      reduces completeness but doesn't diminish overall value.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A solid, practical prompt for Whop platform development that provides actionable
    API examples, though it's incomplete and could benefit from error handling and
    edge case guidance.
