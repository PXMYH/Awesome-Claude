  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections, specific service
      definitions, and actionable workflows. It includes critical AWS documentation
      requirements and handles tool availability scenarios. However, it lacks explicit
      error handling for common deployment failures and doesn't define success criteria
      for verification steps.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill provides practical value for AWS Bedrock AgentCore users
      by consolidating seven core services into a single expert guide. It covers real-world
      deployment patterns and includes credential management workflows. The usefulness
      is slightly limited by its dependency on AWS MCP tools, which may not be available
      in all environments.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured AWS Bedrock AgentCore skill that provides comprehensive
    guidance for deploying and managing AI agent services, though it could benefit
    from more robust error handling and fallback procedures.
