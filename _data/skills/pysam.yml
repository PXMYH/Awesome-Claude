  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections for
      overview, usage scenarios, installation, and examples. It follows prompt engineering
      best practices by providing concrete code snippets and defining scope precisely.
      The only minor limitation is that it references external documentation files
      that may not be accessible to the AI agent.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill has high real-world value for bioinformatics and genomic
      data processing tasks. It covers the most common use cases comprehensively with
      practical code examples that users can immediately adapt. The inclusion of installation
      instructions and specific file format support makes it highly actionable for
      NGS pipeline development.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready skill prompt that provides comprehensive
    coverage of genomic file operations with clear examples and practical guidance
    for bioinformatics workflows.
