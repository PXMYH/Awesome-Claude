  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and practical examples,
      but it's incomplete (cut off mid-sentence in the parameters section). It provides
      good specificity on when to use the skill vs alternatives, and includes helpful
      setup instructions. However, the truncation creates ambiguity about full functionality.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This is a practical image generation skill with real-world applications
      for creating visual assets, concept art, and photo editing. It covers common
      usage patterns comprehensively with concrete examples. The integration with
      OpenRouter provides access to multiple high-quality models, though the dependency
      on external API keys adds setup complexity.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A solid image generation skill with clear structure and practical examples,
    but the incomplete parameter documentation reduces its effectiveness. The skill
    is useful for general-purpose image creation and editing tasks.
