  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: 'The prompt provides clear structure with sections for overview, installation,
      authentication, and core capabilities, but contains a critical flaw: the ''Common
      Patterns'' section is incomplete (truncated mid-code snippet). While the instructions
      for evaluation are clear, the skill prompt itself lacks edge case handling,
      specific constraints, and best practice guidance for model selection or error
      handling.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill covers essential Transformers library functionality across
      NLP, vision, and audio tasks with practical installation commands and authentication
      guidance. It provides actionable quick-start examples and references to detailed
      documentation, making it valuable for developers starting with pre-trained models,
      though the incomplete code snippet reduces immediate usability.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A comprehensive but partially incomplete skill prompt that effectively
    introduces Hugging Face Transformers capabilities, though it needs completion
    of the code examples and addition of error handling guidance to reach full potential.
