  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and practical examples.
      It provides specific API parameters and code snippets that are directly executable.
      However, it lacks explicit error handling guidance and edge case scenarios like
      rate limiting or API downtime.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill offers practical value for clinical research, patient matching,
      and data analysis tasks. The examples cover common use cases like condition-based
      searches and drug trials. However, the prompt is incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence)
      and missing some key features like CSV export functionality and advanced filtering
      options.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A solid foundation for a clinical trials database skill with practical
    examples, but the incomplete prompt and missing advanced features prevent it from
    reaching full potential.
