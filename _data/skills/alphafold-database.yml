  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: 'The prompt provides clear structure and practical code examples for
      accessing AlphaFold data, covering multiple methods (Biopython, direct API,
      UniProt integration). However, it has a critical flaw: the Biopython code examples
      use a non-existent `alphafold_db` module that doesn''t exist in standard Biopython
      distributions, which could mislead users. The prompt also lacks error handling
      examples and doesn''t address rate limiting or API constraints.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The skill addresses a genuine need in structural biology and drug discovery
      by providing concrete methods to access AlphaFold's 200M+ protein structures.
      The examples are practical and cover common workflows like retrieving predictions
      by UniProt ID and downloading files. The inclusion of confidence metrics analysis
      is particularly valuable for assessing prediction reliability in research contexts.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A useful but flawed prompt that provides practical AlphaFold database access
    guidance but contains misleading Biopython examples and lacks error handling considerations.
