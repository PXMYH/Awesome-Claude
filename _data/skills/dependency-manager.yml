  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured with clear categories and checklists,
      demonstrating strong specificity in scope definition. However, it's incomplete—the
      development workflow section cuts off mid-sentence, and the communication protocol
      lacks implementation details for the context query. While the content is comprehensive,
      the abrupt ending and missing sections reduce clarity and completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides exceptional real-world value with detailed checklists
      covering security, compliance, optimization, and multi-ecosystem support. It
      addresses critical developer pain points like vulnerability management and version
      conflicts. The actionable frameworks and systematic approach would immediately
      benefit teams managing complex dependency trees, though the incomplete workflow
      limits immediate implementation.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured but incomplete prompt that excels in comprehensive scope
    definition and practical frameworks, though execution guidance is truncated and
    requires completion for full utility.
