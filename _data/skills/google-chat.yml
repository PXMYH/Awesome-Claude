  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured, with explicit
      commands, examples, and setup instructions. It defines scope (Google Chat operations)
      and constraints (Workspace account required, personal Gmail not supported) effectively.
      However, it lacks explicit error handling guidance or fallback strategies for
      common issues like authentication failures or missing spaces.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This provides practical value for developers needing lightweight Google
      Chat integration without full Google Workspace MCP complexity. The standalone
      OAuth approach and clear command examples make it immediately actionable for
      common tasks like sending messages and managing spaces. However, usefulness
      is limited by requiring a Google Workspace account and not covering all Google
      Chat API features.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured, practical prompt for Google Chat integration that balances
    clarity with actionable commands, though it could benefit from more comprehensive
    error handling and broader feature coverage.
