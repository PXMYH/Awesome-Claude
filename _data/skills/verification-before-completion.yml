  # Verification Before Completion


  ## Overview


  Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.


  **Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and specific, with a strong, unambiguous
      core principle and a well-structured gate function. It effectively handles common
      failure modes and rationalizations through tables and red flags, providing robust
      guidance for edge cases. The only minor weakness is the slightly repetitive
      structure in the 'When To Apply' section, but overall it follows excellent prompt
      engineering practices.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: 'This skill has immense real-world value, directly addressing a critical
      failure mode in AI-assisted development: false confidence and premature completion
      claims. It is comprehensive, covering tests, builds, requirements, and agent
      delegation, and is highly actionable, providing a clear, step-by-step verification
      protocol that users can immediately implement to prevent costly errors and build
      trust.'
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding, high-impact skill that enforces rigorous verification before
    any completion claim, directly combating a common and costly failure mode in development
    workflows.
