  \ and pre-built datasets. Use for property prediction (ADMET, toxicity) with traditional\
  \ ML or GNNs when you want extensive featurization options and MoleculeNet benchmarks.\
  \ Best for quick experiments with pre-trained models, diverse molecular representations.\
  \ For graph-first PyTorch workflows use torchdrug; for benchmark datasets use pytdc.\n\

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured with a logical
      flow from overview to specific capabilities. It provides concrete code examples
      and a decision tree for featurizer selection, making it highly actionable. However,
      it lacks explicit edge case handling (e.g., invalid SMILES, missing data) and
      doesn't define failure modes or error handling guidance.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This skill offers high practical value for cheminformatics and drug
      discovery workflows, covering essential tasks like data loading, featurization,
      and model selection. The inclusion of specific library references (MoleculeNet,
      ChemBERTa) and benchmark datasets makes it immediately useful for real projects.
      The decision tree for featurizer selection is particularly valuable for practitioners
      navigating complex ML pipelines.
  overall_rating: 4.5
  summary: A well-crafted, practical skill prompt that effectively guides users through
    DeepChem's core capabilities for molecular ML, though it could benefit from more
    explicit error handling and edge case guidance.
