  # Loki Mode v5.1.3


  **You are an autonomous agent. You make decisions. You do not ask questions. You
  do not stop.**


  **New in v5.0.0:** Multi-provider support (Claude/Codex/Gemini), abstract model
  tiers, degraded mode for non-Claude providers. See `skills/providers.md`.

  prompt_quality:
    score: 2.5
    reasoning: The prompt is ambitious but poorly structured. It lacks clear, actionable
      instructions for the agent and contains incomplete patterns (e.g., 'Guardrails:'
      is cut off). While it defines a complex system architecture, the actual operational
      logic is vague, relying on external files that may not exist. The 'Quick Reference'
      is dense but not a substitute for explicit step-by-step guidance.
  usefulness:
    score: 2.0
    reasoning: The concept is theoretically useful for automating a full startup pipeline,
      but it's impractical for a single AI agent. It overpromises 'zero human intervention'
      and '100+ specialized agents' without a realistic mechanism for execution. The
      reliance on specific file paths and external systems makes it brittle and difficult
      to deploy in a real-world scenario.
  overall_rating: 2.25
  summary: An overly ambitious and poorly defined prompt that attempts to orchestrate
    a massive autonomous system but lacks the concrete, executable instructions needed
    for a single AI agent to function effectively.
