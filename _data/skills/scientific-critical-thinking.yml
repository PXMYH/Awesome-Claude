  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, specific
      evaluation frameworks, and actionable guidance. It follows best practices by
      defining scope, providing structured evaluation criteria, and including visual
      enhancement instructions. The only minor limitation is that the methodology
      critique section appears truncated in the provided content.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immense practical value for scientific analysis,
      research evaluation, and critical thinking tasks. It covers comprehensive evaluation
      frameworks (GRADE, Cochrane ROB), addresses real-world research scenarios, and
      includes visual communication enhancement. The structured approach makes it
      immediately actionable for researchers, reviewers, and educators.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding scientific critical thinking skill with comprehensive frameworks,
    clear structure, and practical applications for research evaluation and analysis.
