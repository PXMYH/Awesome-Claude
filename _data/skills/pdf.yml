  prompt_quality:
    score: 2.5
    reasoning: The prompt provides clear code examples for common PDF operations,
      but lacks critical context about required installations, environment setup,
      and error handling. The incomplete code snippet at the end demonstrates poor
      attention to detail, and there's no guidance on handling edge cases like corrupted
      files or permission issues.
  usefulness:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The skill covers practical PDF manipulation tasks including text extraction,
      table extraction, merging, splitting, and creation, which are valuable for real-world
      document processing workflows. However, the incomplete example and missing installation
      instructions reduce immediate usability, requiring users to research additional
      setup steps.
  overall_rating: 3.0
  summary: A moderately useful PDF processing guide with practical code examples,
    but significantly hampered by an incomplete code snippet and missing setup instructions
    that would hinder immediate implementation.
