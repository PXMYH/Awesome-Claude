  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections for description,
      when to use, quick reference, and core features. It provides specific actionable
      steps and follows good prompt engineering practices by defining scope and constraints.
      However, it is incomplete (cuts off mid-sentence in the Core Workflow section)
      and lacks edge case handling or fallback guidance for common issues.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This prompt offers high real-world value for security professionals
      testing web applications, covering essential features like Proxy, Scanner, Repeater,
      and Intruder. It is comprehensive for introductory to intermediate use cases
      and highly actionable with quick reference tables and installation steps. The
      inclusion of alternatives (e.g., OWASP ZAP) adds practical decision-making context.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A strong, practical prompt for Burp Suite Professional that excels in clarity
    and real-world applicability but is limited by its incomplete workflow section.
