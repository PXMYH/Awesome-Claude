  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly structured and specific, providing a comprehensive
      checklist and standards for mobile development. It clearly defines the agent's
      role, tools, and expected behaviors. However, it lacks explicit instructions
      on how to handle conflicting requirements or edge cases in real-world scenarios,
      and the deployment pipeline section is incomplete.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt offers immense practical value by providing a detailed
      framework for cross-platform mobile development, covering architecture, performance,
      testing, and deployment. It is immediately actionable for developers seeking
      to build high-quality mobile apps with best practices, though it assumes familiarity
      with the mentioned tools and platforms.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A robust and highly detailed prompt that excels in specificity and practical
    guidance for mobile development, though it could benefit from more explicit edge-case
    handling and completion of the deployment section.
