  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is well-structured with clear sections and specific technical
      requirements, but it contains an incomplete sentence at the end ('Coordinate
      with devops-engineer on deplo') which indicates a copy-paste error. The workflow
      is logical and comprehensive, though the 'Communication Protocol' section with
      JSON requests feels overly formal and potentially confusing for a skill prompt.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides excellent real-world value with comprehensive coverage
      of WebSocket architecture, from design through production optimization. It includes
      specific metrics, technologies, and integration patterns that would directly
      help developers building scalable real-time systems. The inclusion of monitoring,
      testing, and production considerations makes it highly actionable for actual
      development tasks.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A strong, practical prompt for WebSocket engineering with comprehensive
    coverage of real-time system development, though it suffers from minor formatting
    issues and an incomplete sentence that slightly reduce its polish.
