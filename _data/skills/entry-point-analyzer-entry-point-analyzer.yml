  description: Analyzes smart contract codebases to identify state-changing entry
  points for security auditing. Detects externally callable functions that modify
  state, categorizes them by access level (public, admin, role-restricted, contract-only),
  and generates structured audit reports. Excludes view/pure/read-only functions.
  Use when auditing smart contracts (Solidity, Vyper, Solana/Rust, Move, TON, CosmWasm)
  or when asked to find entry points, audit flows, exter...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and well-structured with explicit
      scope definitions, language-specific exclusions, and a defined workflow. It
      follows best practices by providing concrete examples and fallback guidance
      for when Slither is unavailable. The only minor weakness is the incomplete language
      detection table at the end, which cuts off mid-sentence.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides high practical value for security auditors by systematically
      mapping attack surfaces in smart contract codebases. It's immediately actionable
      with a clear workflow and covers multiple blockchain ecosystems, making it versatile
      for real-world auditing scenarios. The focus on state-changing functions aligns
      perfectly with security priorities.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, production-ready security skill that provides clear methodology
    for identifying critical entry points in smart contract audits across multiple
    blockchain platforms.
