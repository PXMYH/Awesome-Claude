  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: 'The prompt is well-structured with clear sections for overview, capabilities,
      installation, and usage examples. However, it contains a critical flaw: the
      alignment example is incomplete (ends with ''ali'' without code completion),
      and the metadata shows an impossible release date (Biopython 1.85 in January
      2025, when the knowledge cutoff is December 2024). The prompt also lacks explicit
      error handling guidance for common bioinformatics tasks.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This is highly practical for bioinformatics work, covering essential
      tasks like sequence manipulation, file parsing, database access, and BLAST automation.
      The modular organization by sub-packages helps users quickly find relevant functionality.
      The inclusion of specific version requirements and setup instructions makes
      it immediately actionable for real-world computational biology pipelines.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A comprehensive and well-organized bioinformatics skill prompt with strong
    practical value, though it contains minor technical inaccuracies and an incomplete
    code example that slightly undermine its reliability.
