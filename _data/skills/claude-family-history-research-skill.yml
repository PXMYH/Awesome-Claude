    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt demonstrates excellent clarity and specificity with explicit
      prohibitions against unsolicited research and a clear sequential workflow. It
      follows strong prompt engineering practices by defining triggers, capabilities,
      and critical constraints. However, it references external template files that
      may not exist in the actual system, which could create implementation issues.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: This skill provides high real-world value for genealogy research by
      enforcing systematic planning methodology, which is a professional standard
      in the field. It covers core genealogical workflows comprehensively including
      planning, citation, and evidence analysis. The actionable nature allows users
      to immediately benefit from structured guidance rather than random searching.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A well-structured genealogy planning skill that enforces professional research
    methodology through clear constraints and workflows, though it may need adjustment
    for template file dependencies.
