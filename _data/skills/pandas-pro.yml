  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear role definition,
      specific constraints (MUST DO/MUST NOT DO), and a comprehensive workflow. It
      follows best practices by defining triggers, scope, and output format. The only
      minor limitation is the reference guide pointing to external files that may
      not exist in all contexts.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world data engineering tasks, covering
      essential pandas operations from loading to optimization. The constraints prevent
      common anti-patterns like iterrows and chained indexing, making it immediately
      actionable for production code. The performance optimization focus addresses
      critical concerns for large datasets.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An expert-level pandas prompt with excellent structure, clear constraints,
    and production-ready guidance that balances best practices with practical implementation.
