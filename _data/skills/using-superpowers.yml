  <EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>

  If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing,
  you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.


  IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.


  This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your...'

  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally clear and specific, with strong visual
      flow diagrams and explicit red flags that prevent rationalization. It defines
      scope, constraints, and expected behavior through concrete examples and a priority
      system. The only minor weakness is the extreme rigidity might cause issues in
      edge cases where no skill truly applies, though the '1% chance' threshold is
      explicitly defined.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for development workflows, providing immediate
      value by enforcing systematic skill usage that prevents ad-hoc approaches. The
      comprehensive coverage of skill types, priorities, and common rationalization
      traps makes it immediately actionable for users. It directly addresses the common
      problem of AI agents skipping established workflows in favor of quick fixes.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, highly structured prompt that enforces disciplined skill
    usage with clear rules, visual workflows, and anti-rationalization safeguards,
    making it extremely valuable for development tasks requiring systematic approaches.
