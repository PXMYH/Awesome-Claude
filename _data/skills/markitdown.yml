  prompt_quality:
    score: 2.5
    reasoning: 'The prompt is clear about the tool''s capabilities and provides good
      technical documentation, but it contains a significant flaw: it incorrectly
      attributes MarkItDown to Microsoft (it''s actually developed by Microsoft, but
      the prompt states ''developed by Microsoft'' which is accurate, but the overall
      structure is confusing). More critically, it inappropriately mixes tool documentation
      with unsolicited instructions to use a separate ''scientific-schematics'' skill,
      creating scope creep and potential confusion about the tool''s actual purpose.'
  usefulness:
    score: 3.0
    reasoning: The core documentation for MarkItDown is practical and valuable for
      users needing file format conversion, with comprehensive format support and
      clear usage examples. However, the usefulness is diminished by the irrelevant
      and potentially misleading instructions about generating scientific schematics,
      which distracts from the primary task of file conversion and may lead users
      to expect features not present in the actual tool.
  overall_rating: 2.75
  summary: This prompt provides technically accurate documentation for MarkItDown
    but is compromised by inappropriate scope expansion and confusing instructions
    about unrelated schematic generation, reducing its overall effectiveness as a
    skill prompt.
