  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear role definition,
      specific constraints, and actionable guidelines. It follows prompt engineering
      best practices with defined triggers, scope, and output format. The only minor
      limitation is the incomplete output template section, which cuts off mid-sentence.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This skill provides immediate, practical value for Spark development
      with comprehensive coverage of real-world scenarios. The constraints and reference
      guide structure enable users to quickly implement production-grade Spark applications.
      The workflow and best practices directly address common performance bottlenecks
      and optimization strategies.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An expertly crafted Spark engineering skill with exceptional clarity, practical
    constraints, and comprehensive guidance for building and optimizing distributed
    data processing pipelines.
