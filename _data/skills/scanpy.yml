  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: 'The prompt provides clear, structured instructions with well-organized
      sections and practical code examples. However, it has some issues: the clustering
      section is incomplete (cut off mid-code block), and it lacks error handling
      guidance or edge case considerations for common scRNA-seq analysis problems.'
  usefulness:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world single-cell RNA-seq analysis,
      covering the complete standard workflow from QC to visualization. The code examples
      are immediately actionable and follow established best practices, though the
      incomplete clustering section reduces immediate usability.
  overall_rating: 4.25
  summary: A solid, practical skill for scRNA-seq analysis with comprehensive workflow
    coverage, but needs completion of the clustering section and addition of error
    handling guidance to reach full potential.
