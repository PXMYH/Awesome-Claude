  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, comprehensive
      code examples, and logical workflow organization. It follows best practices
      by including installation instructions, import conventions, and practical examples
      for common tasks. However, it contains incomplete code snippets (e.g., truncated
      descriptor output) and references external documentation files that may not
      be available to the user.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This is highly practical for real-world drug discovery workflows, covering
      essential cheminformatics tasks from molecule parsing to file I/O and descriptor
      calculation. The examples are immediately actionable and demonstrate best practices
      like standardization and error handling. The skill bridges RDKit's complexity
      with a more accessible interface, making it valuable for both beginners and
      experienced practitioners.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: A comprehensive, well-organized cheminformatics skill prompt that provides
    excellent practical value for drug discovery tasks, though slightly marred by
    incomplete code examples and external references.
