  prompt_quality:
    score: 3.5
    reasoning: The prompt is highly specific and structured with clear sections for
      different backend development aspects, following good prompt engineering practices.
      However, it is incomplete—the Development Workflow section cuts off mid-sentence
      ('Security b'), and the Communication Protocol section lacks a clear mechanism
      for the agent to actually execute the context query or receive the response.
  usefulness:
    score: 4.0
    reasoning: The prompt provides comprehensive, real-world backend development guidelines
      covering API design, database architecture, security, performance, and microservices
      patterns, making it highly practical for senior-level tasks. The detailed checklists
      and standards offer immediate actionable value for developers building scalable
      systems, though the incomplete workflow reduces immediate usability.
  overall_rating: 3.75
  summary: A well-structured and detailed backend development prompt with strong practical
    value, but it is critically incomplete, lacking a defined execution flow and a
    complete workflow section.
