  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, comprehensive
      code examples, and practical notes on error handling. It follows best practices
      by including important warnings about None returns and sanitization behavior.
      The only minor limitation is that it doesn't explicitly address version compatibility
      or environment setup, which could be relevant for users.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides immediate, actionable value for cheminformatics
      tasks with production-ready code examples covering the most common workflows.
      It thoughtfully distinguishes between simple use cases (recommending datamol)
      and advanced control (using RDKit directly), demonstrating deep domain knowledge.
      The inclusion of batch processing, error handling, and performance considerations
      makes it highly practical for real research and development tasks.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An outstanding cheminformatics skill prompt that balances comprehensive
    technical coverage with practical guidance, making it immediately useful for both
    beginners and experienced practitioners in drug discovery and computational chemistry.
