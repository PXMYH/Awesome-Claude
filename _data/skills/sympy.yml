  prompt_quality:
    score: 4.5
    reasoning: The prompt is exceptionally well-structured with clear sections, comprehensive
      coverage of SymPy's capabilities, and practical code examples. It follows excellent
      prompt engineering practices by defining when to use the skill, providing core
      capabilities with examples, and referencing detailed documentation. The only
      minor issue is that the 'Matrices and Linear Algebra' section appears incomplete
      (cuts off mid-sentence), which slightly impacts completeness.
  usefulness:
    score: 5.0
    reasoning: This prompt provides immediate practical value for anyone working with
      symbolic mathematics in Python. It covers a comprehensive range of real-world
      applications including calculus, equation solving, physics calculations, and
      code generation. The inclusion of specific code examples and references to detailed
      documentation makes it highly actionable for both beginners and experienced
      users.
  overall_rating: 4.75
  summary: An excellent, comprehensive prompt that effectively guides users through
    SymPy's symbolic mathematics capabilities with clear structure, practical examples,
    and appropriate scope for scientific computing tasks.
