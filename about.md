# About Claude Skills Directory

This directory aggregates, evaluates, and ranks Claude skills, agents, and subagents from various community sources.

## How It Works

1. **Aggregation**: We collect skills from curated awesome lists like [VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents)

2. **Evaluation**: Each skill is evaluated using an LLM-as-judge approach via OpenRouter, scoring:
   - **Prompt Quality**: Clarity, specificity, and adherence to best practices
   - **Usefulness**: Real-world applicability and completeness

3. **Metrics**: We also display objective GitHub metrics (stars, forks, last commit) separately from quality ratings
