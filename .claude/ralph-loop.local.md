Implement docs/PLAN.md - split the plan implementation to different phases, commit after each phase, validate visual by launching playwright mcp, validate functionality by writing unit tests. Success Criteria: all features are implemented, Tests are passing, Documentation update. You are granted all read and write permissions except delete. Note the user has limited availability so when in doubt note down the problem decision you wanted the user input into a file decisions.md under docs folder, think deeply, make a decision, and move on
